    "style_variations_raw": "This intensity scale breaks the subjective effects of DXM into 6 distinct levels in which each tier typically contains an expanding list of effects that proportionally intensify relative to the dosage consumed. The approximate frequency of occurence for each effect at a given level is also listed in relation to a system which can be found here. \n\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that an individuals required DXM dosage to reach a particular range of effects seem to vary widely between people in a manner which is dependent on body weight and personal neurochemistry. It is therefore common for people within the psychonaut community to use ##ext-link|href=\"http://dxm.tripsit.me/\"{DXM calculators} which predict the required dosage depending on body weight. These dosage calculators usually refer to a 5 tier plateau system that was popularised in 2002 by ##ext-link|href=\"https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml\"{Erowid's DXM FAQ}. Although the levelling system documented on this page here is approximately although not entirely analogous to this plateau system, it is important to keep in mind that there are a number of subtle differences.\n##md{### 1. Subtle (50 - 100 mg)}At the lowest level, DXM typically induces a small range of subtle cognitive effects which may be beneficial for enhancing a person's sociability, energy levels, relaxation, and creativity. There may also be a sensation that the body feels lighter, resulting in a sense of bounciness and ease of movement. However, these changes may be difficult to distinguish between that of genuine alterations and the placebo effect, unless the person is already familiar with the substance.\n\nThis range of DXM intensity roughly analogous to the \"first plateau\". The specific subtle effects which generally occur at this level of intensity are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, each of which are listed below:\n\n##md{\n* [**Stimulation**](https://effectindex.com/effects/stimulation)\n* [**Perception of bodily lightness**](https://effectindex.com/effects/perception-of-bodily-lightness)\n* [**Thought acceleration**](https://effectindex.com/effects/thought-acceleration)\n* [**Anxiety suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/anxiety-suppression)\n* [**Conceptual thinking**](https://effectindex.com/effects/conceptual-thinking)\n* [**Creativity enhancement**](https://effectindex.com/effects/creativity-enhancement)\n* [**Novelty enhancement**](https://effectindex.com/effects/novelty-enhancement)}##md{### 2. Mild (100 - 200mg)}At this level, the effects of DXM can be generally described as a subtle dulling of the senses and a vague sense of subjective detachment from the external environment that is accompanied by a distinct sense of mood elevation, sociability, and stimulation. This is accompanied by spontaneous bodily sensations or a \"body high\" which can be described as a sharp, pleasurable, and warm tingling sensation which is sometimes localised to the hands, feet, and head. \n\nAt this point, the user may have to pay direct attention to the effects of the substance for them to be recognisable, or they may be slightly noticeable but will not insist upon the user's attention.\n\nThis range of DXM is colloquially referred to as the \"second plateau\".  The specific subtle effects which generally occur at this level of intensity are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, each of which are listed below:\n##md{#### Sensory\n* [**Acuity suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/acuity-suppression)\n* [**Auditory suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/auditory-suppression)\n* [**Tactile suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/tactile-suppression)}##md{#### Cognitive\n* [**Anxiety suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/anxiety-suppression)\n* [**Cognitive euphoria**](https://effectindex.com/effects/cognitive-euphoria)\n* [**Creativity enhancement**](https://effectindex.com/effects/creativity-enhancement)\n* [**Conceptual thinking**](https://effectindex.com/effects/conceptual-thinking)\n* [**Novelty enhancement**](https://effectindex.com/effects/novelty-enhancement)\n* [**Thought acceleration**](https://effectindex.com/effects/thought-acceleration)\n* [**Increased music appreciation**](https://effectindex.com/effects/increased-music-appreciation)}##md{#### Physical\n* [**Spontaneous bodily sensations**](https://effectindex.com/effects/spontaneous-bodily-sensations) (level ~1)\n* [**Stimulation**](https://effectindex.com/effects/stimulation)\n* [**Perception of bodily lightness**](https://effectindex.com/effects/perception-of-bodily-lightness)}##md{### 3. Distinct (200 - 400 mg)}At this level, the environment starts to feel physically further away in distance and increasingly disconnected from a person’s sensory perception. Partially blurred and double vision sets in while anaesthetic-like effects such as tactile numbness begin to take place. Other physical faculties such as motor control, coordination, and balance become somewhat suppressed and mechanical in a manner that is partially compensated for by a feeling of the body being in \"autopilot\". These physical effects are also accompanied by a pronounced feeling of sedation that completely overtakes the stimulation which is felt at lower dosages. \n\nIn terms of sound, although one's sense of music appreciation will have profoundly increased, the clarity of sound itself may also seem as if it has become vague, muffled, and distant. \n\nAccompanying these effects, a number of inconsistent and brief visual distortions may also occur spontaneously during certain dissociative experiences. These distortions can include alterations in perceived distances between objects,  visual segmentation of one's vision into glitch-like cubes or slices, and changes to the perceived size of one's body or the environment.\n\nDuring this level, if one allows themselves to relax while closing their eyes, they may fleetingly find that they are drifting off into a darkened hallucinatory void filled with psychedelic geometry, simplistic shapes, forms, and structures. This is usually a very brief experience which can easily be interrupted by external stimuli such as noises and other general distractions.\n\nWith DXM in particular, it is worth noting that its geometry is typically much more distinct, colourful, pronounced, and psychedelic-esque in comparison to that of other more commonly used dissociatives. Although it does typically extend beyond level 5 geometry is not entirely on par with a typical psychedelic in terms of complexity, it can often very come close in terms of its intensity, colour palette, and vividness. However, it does not seem to extend beyond level 4 geometry.  It can be comprehensively described through its variations as ##i{intricate in complexity, algorithmic in style, synthetic in feel, unstructured in organization, brightly lit in lighting, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, small in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity}.\n\nDepending on the person's level of experience, these effects can be allowed to occupy a predominant role within the person's perception or they may be mostly ignored and made somewhat secondary to other chosen activities.\n\nThis range of DXM is colloquially referred to as the \"third plateau\". The specific distinct effects which generally occur at this level of intensity are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, each of which are listed below:\n##md{#### Sensory\n* [**Acuity suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/acuity-suppression)\n* [**Auditory suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/auditory-suppression)\n* [**Double vision**](https://effectindex.com/effects/double-vision) (level 1-2)\n* [**Environmental cubism**](https://effectindex.com/effects/environmental-cubism)\n* [**Perspective distortion**](https://effectindex.com/effects/perspective-distortion)\n* [**Scenery slicing**](https://effectindex.com/effects/scenery-slicing)\n* [**Tactile suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/tactile-suppression)\n* [**Visual disconnection**](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection)\n  * [**Holes, spaces, and voids**](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids)\n  * [**Structures**](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures) (level 1-2)\n#### Cognitive\n* [**Anxiety suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/anxiety-suppression)\n* [**Cognitive disconnection**](https://effectindex.com/effects/cognitive-disconnection)\n* [**Cognitive euphoria**](https://effectindex.com/effects/cognitive-euphoria)\n* [**Conceptual thinking**](https://effectindex.com/effects/conceptual-thinking)\n* [**Derpersonalization**](https://effectindex.com/effects/depersonalization)\n* [**Derealization**](https://effectindex.com/effects/derealization)\n* [**Existential self-realization**](https://effectindex.com/effects/existential-self-realization)\n* [**Increased music appreciation**](https://effectindex.com/effects/increased-music-appreciation)\n* [**Immersion enhancement**](https://effectindex.com/effects/immersion-enhancement)\n* [**Introspection**](https://effectindex.com/effects/introspection)\n* [**Novelty enhancement**](https://effectindex.com/effects/novelty-enhancement)\n* [**Thought deceleration**](https://effectindex.com/effects/thought-deceleration)\n#### Physical\n* [**Nausea**](https://effectindex.com/effects/nausea)\n* [**Pain relief**](https://effectindex.com/effects/pain-relief)\n* [**Physical autonomy**](https://effectindex.com/effects/physical-autonomy)\n* [**Physical euphoria**](https://effectindex.com/effects/physical-euphoria)\n* [**Sedation**](https://effectindex.com/effects/sedation)\n* [**Spontaneous bodily sensations**](https://effectindex.com/effects/spontaneous-bodily-sensations) (level ~2)}##md{### 4. Strong (400 - 600 mg)}At this level, the sensory and cognitive disconnection has completely blocked out one’s perception of the external environment. It is here where the person finds themselves undergoing an out-of-body experience as they float in a variety of directions and orientations through a \"dissociative hole\" which can be described as an expansive darkened void containing a wide array of internal hallucinations and structures. These structures are usually formed from solid materials which can take the form of any shape. However, common examples include vast and monolithic pillars, columns, tunnels, blocks, buildings, slides, monuments, wheels, pyramids, caves, and a variety of abstract or fractal shapes. \n\nThe internal hallucinations that occur at this level and above can be comprehensively described through their style variations as a combination of lucid and delirious in believability, fixed in style, primarily new experiences over memory replays in content, autonomous in controllability, and solid in style.\n\nIt is worth noting that although the effects mentioned above are entirely consistent with that of other more traditional dissociatives, DXM can also present a comparatively higher occurrence of accompanying effects such as complex geometry, internal hallucinations, and spirituality enhancement.\n\nThis is the level at which the effects become powerful enough to render the person undergoing them as incapable of functioning, interacting normally, or thinking in a sober manner. At this level, the effects of the substance are clear and can no longer be ignored in any capacity, leaving the user entirely engaged in the experience whether they wish to be or not. In terms of how this looks from an outsiders perspective, the person will usually appear to be heavily sedated and almost entirely unconscious.\n\nThis range of DXM is colloquially referred to as the \"fourth plateau\".  The specific distinct effects which generally occur at this level of intensity are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, each of which are listed below:\n##md{#### Sensory\n* [**Acuity suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/acuity-suppression)\n* [**Auditory suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/auditory-suppression)\n* [**Double vision**](https://effectindex.com/effects/double-vision) (level 2-3)\n* [**Environmental cubism**](https://effectindex.com/effects/environmental-cubism)\n* [**Geometry**](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry) (level 1-3)\n* [**Internal hallucination**](https://effectindex.com/effects/internal-hallucination) (level 1-3)\n* [**Perspective distortion**](https://effectindex.com/effects/perspective-distortion)\n* [**Scenery slicing**](https://effectindex.com/effects/scenery-slicing)\n* [**Tactile suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/tactile-suppression)\n* [**Visual disconnection**](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection)\n  * [**Holes, spaces, and voids**](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids)\n  * [**Structures**](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures) (level 2-3)\n#### Cognitive\n* [**Anxiety suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/anxiety-suppression)\n* [**Cognitive disconnection**](https://effectindex.com/effects/cognitive-disconnection)\n* [**Cognitive euphoria**](https://effectindex.com/effects/cognitive-euphoria)\n* [**Conceptual thinking**](https://effectindex.com/effects/conceptual-thinking)\n* [**Derpersonalization**](https://effectindex.com/effects/depersonalization)\n* [**Derealization**](https://effectindex.com/effects/derealization)\n* [**Existential self-realization**](https://effectindex.com/effects/existential-self-realization)\n* [**Immersion enhancement**](https://effectindex.com/effects/immersion-enhancement)\n* [**Increased music appreciation**](https://effectindex.com/effects/increased-music-appreciation)\n* [**Introspection**](https://effectindex.com/effects/introspection)\n* [**Memory suppression**](https://effectindex.com/effects/memory-suppression) (level 1-2)\n* [**Novelty enhancement**](https://effectindex.com/effects/novelty-enhancement)\n* [**Spirituality enhancement**](https://effectindex.com/effects/spirituality-enhancement)\n* [**Thought deceleration**](https://effectindex.com/effects/thought-deceleration)\n#### Physical\n* [**Changes in felt gravity**](https://effectindex.com/effects/changes-in-felt-gravity)\n* [**Nausea**](https://effectindex.com/effects/nausea)\n* [**Pain relief**](https://effectindex.com/effects/pain-relief)\n* [**Physical autonomy**](https://effectindex.com/effects/physical-autonomy)\n* [**Physical euphoria**](https://effectindex.com/effects/physical-euphoria)\n* [**Sedation**](https://effectindex.com/effects/sedation)\n* [**Spontaneous bodily sensations**](https://effectindex.com/effects/spontaneous-bodily-sensations) (level ~2)}##md{### 5.

Extreme (700 - 1000 mg +)}The highest level of detachment occurs when a person loses all sensory awareness and normal cognitive functioning. This renders the person unconscious and consistently leaves extended gaps in a person’s memory with large periods of amnesia which are generally impossible to recall once the experience is over. It’s at this level that dissociatives such as ketamine are used in medical procedures for their anaesthetic effects.\n\nAt this level, the person will experience the effects typically associated with the previously described heavy dosage during the onset and offset of their trip. During the peak, however, they will simply black out and become unconscious for a prolonged period of time that is directly proportional to the dosage consumed.\n\nAlthough this extreme dissociative state may be attractive to certain individuals, it is worth noting that this level of intensity is not only potentially dangerous but also less therapeutic and explorative than the previous levels. With DXM in particular, it is said by sites such as ##ext-link|href=\"https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_dose.shtml\"{Erowid} that dosages between 2,500 mg and 20,000 mg are capable of resulting in death. However, this seems unusually high to me, and I would not personally be surprised if dosages closer to 1000mg were capable of causing a fatal overdose within certain individuals that have a lower body weight or a higher sensitivty.\n##md{### Experience reports}Anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our experience index include:\n\n##md{- [**Re-discovering DXM**](https://effectindex.com/reports/re-discovering-dxm) by [*Josie Kins*](https://effectindex.com/profiles/Josie)\n- [**Heavy dose of cough syrup**](https://effectindex.com/reports/heavy-dose-of-cough-syrup) by *Gabriel*}",

These physical effects are also accompanied by a pronounced feeling of sedation that completely overtakes the stimulation which is felt at lower dosages. \\n\\nIn terms of sound, although one's sense of music appreciation will have profoundly increased, the clarity of sound itself may also seem as if it has become vague, muffled, and distant. \\n\\nAccompanying these effects, a number of inconsistent and brief visual distortions may also occur spontaneously during certain dissociative experiences.

Partially blurred and double vision sets in, and anaesthetic-like effects such as [tactile numbness](https://effectindex.com/effects/tactile-suppression) begin to take place. \\n\\nOther physical faculties such as [motor control, coordination, and balance](https://effectindex.com/effects/motor-control-loss) become somewhat suppressed in a manner that is partially compensated for by a feeling of the body being in a state of \\\"autopilot\\\". Interestingly enough, this suppression of motor control is unique in its style as it frequently results in users moving around in a [robotic and mechanical-like gait](https://effectindex.com/effects/gait-alteration) that does not seem to present itself under the influence of other dissociative substances. Within the DXM community, this is colloquially referred to as a \\\"robo walk\\\".\\n\\nThese physical effects are also accompanied by a pronounced feeling of [bodily sedation](https://effectindex.com/effects/sedation) that begins to overtake the [stimulation](https://effectindex.com/effects/stimulation) that is felt at lower dosages, and is accompanied by other [cognitive suppressions](https://effectindex.com/categories/cognitive-suppressions) such as [thought deceleration](https://effectindex.com/effects/thought-deceleration). However, this sedation should not be confused with a sense of actual [sleepiness](https://effectindex.com/effects/sleepiness) as it is more comparable to feeling extremely heavy and unable to move one's body. Alongside of this, the user will likely feel a sense of persistent [dry mouth](https://effectindex.com/effects/dry-mouth) or [mild dehydration](https://effectindex.com/effects/dehydration) that often requires periodic sipping of water to keep it from reaching significant levels of discomfort.\\n\\nVarious adverse effects such as itching and rashes may also occur at this dosage range and above. Although it is uncommon, it is worth noting that a certain percentage of people seem to experience [itchiness](https://effectindex.com/effects/itchiness) on DXM that is comparable to that which occurs on opioids such morphine, kratom, and heroin. This is colloquially referred to as a \\\"robo itch\\\" within the DXM community and is likely a result of histamine release. \\n\\nIn terms of auditory perception, the clarity of sound itself may seem as if it has become [vague, muffled, and distant](https://effectindex.com/effects/auditory-suppression). Nonetheless, one's sense of [music appreciation](https://effectindex.com/effects/increased-music-appreciation) will have profoundly increased.  \\n\\nRegarding visual effects, some inconsistent and brief distortions may also occur spontaneously during dissociative experiences. These distortions can include alterations in perceived distances between objects, visual segmentation of one's vision into glitch-like [cubes](https://effectindex.com/effects/environmental-cubism) or [slices](https://effectindex.com/effects/scenery-slicing), and changes to the perceived size of one's body or the environment.\\n\\nDuring this level, if one allows themselves to relax while closing their eyes, they may find that they are fleetingly and partially drifting off into a [darkened hallucinatory void](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids) filled with vague [psychedelic geometry](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry) alongside simplistic [shapes, forms, and structures](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures). This is usually a very brief and indistinct experience, which can quickly be interrupted by external stimuli such as noises or other distractions.\\n\\nWith DXM in particular, it is worth noting that its [geometry](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry) is typically much more distinct, colourful, pronounced, and psychedelic-esque in comparison to that of other more commonly used dissociatives. Although it does not usually extend beyond level 5 geometry and is not entirely on par with a typical psychedelic in terms of complexity, it can often come very close in terms of its intensity, colour palette, and vividness. This effect will typically begin to manifest at this level subtly, and its intensity increases proportional to the dosage consumed. It can be comprehensively described through its [style variations](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry?s=variations) as *intricate in complexity, algorithmic in style, unstructured in organization, brightly lit in lighting, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, small in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity*.\\n\\nThere is also a distinct possibility that the user may experience stereotypical psychedelic drifting which causes the environment to appear to warp, morph, bend, and flow. However, although this effect is more common on DXM in comparison to that of other more common dissociatives, it is still substantially less common in comparison to that of a traditional psychedelic. The [style variations of this drifting](https://effectindex.com/effects/drifting?s=variations) are simple in complexity, slow-moving, smooth in perceived framerate, constant throughout, and unrealistic in its appearance.\\n\\nDepending on the person's level of experience with this substance, these effects can be allowed to occupy a predominant role within the person's perception, or they may be partially ignored and made somewhat secondary to other chosen activities.\\n\\nThis level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to a state which is colloquially referred to as the \\\"[third plateau](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.7)\\\".

These effects intensity proportionally to the dosage consumed. The approximate frequency of occurrence is also listed alongside each effect. For an explanation of the terms used within this frequency measuring system, please see the article ##int-link|to=\"/effects/approximate-frequency-of-occurrence-scale\"{here}. \n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that the dosages provided here are average measurements that are comparable to recommendations made by ##ext-link|href=\"https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM\"{PsychonautWiki} and ##ext-link|href=\"https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_dose.shtml\"{Erowid}. The DXM dose required to reach a given range of effects seems to vary widely between individuals, depending on both body weight and neurochemistry. This variation in dosage sensitivity appears to be far more common among DXM users than almost any other hallucinogenic substance. For example, while some people may find themselves unusually sensitive to this compound, others will require a much higher dose than those recommended by this article and other reliable sources. \n\nIt is therefore common for people within the psychonaut community to use ##ext-link|href=\"http://dxm.tripsit.me/\"{DXM calculators} which predict the required dosage depending on body weight. These dosage calculators usually refer to a 5 tier plateau system that was popularised in 2002 by ##ext-link|href=\"https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml\"{Erowid's DXM FAQ}.

Although it is comparable in its style to the entactogenia induced by substances such as MDMA, it is much subtler in its intensity and forcefulness in a manner which is similar to that of 2C-B. However, this effect is usually only present at these lower levels of intensity as when the dosage is increased, it eventually gives way to more typical dissociative effects.\n\nThese effects are accompanied by mild but pleasurable spontaneous tactile sensations which are commonly referred to as a \"body high.\" The specific details of which can be described through its [style variations](https://effectindex.com/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations?s=variations) as *moving in motion, sporadic in consistency, sharp in sensation, euphoric in pleasurableness, and often localised in its position to the hands, feet, or head*.\n\nAt this point, the user may have to pay direct attention to the effects of the substance for them to be recognisable, or they may be noticeable but will not necessarily demand the user's attention.\n\nThis level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[second plateau](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.4)\".

Partially blurred and double vision sets in, and anaesthetic-like effects such as [tactile numbness](https://effectindex.com/effects/tactile-suppression) begin to take place. \n\nOther physical faculties such as [motor control, coordination, and balance](https://effectindex.com/effects/motor-control-loss) become somewhat suppressed in a manner that is partially compensated for by a feeling of the body being in a state of \"autopilot\". Interestingly enough, this suppression of motor control is unique in its style as it frequently results in users moving around in a [robotic and mechanical-like gait](https://effectindex.com/effects/gait-alteration) that does not seem to present itself under the influence of other dissociative substances. Within the DXM community, this is colloquially referred to as a \"robo walk\".\n\nThese physical effects are also accompanied by a pronounced feeling of [bodily sedation](https://effectindex.com/effects/sedation) that begins to overtake the [stimulation](https://effectindex.com/effects/stimulation) that is felt at lower dosages, and is accompanied by other [cognitive suppressions](https://effectindex.com/categories/cognitive-suppressions) such as [thought deceleration](https://effectindex.com/effects/thought-deceleration). However, this sedation should not be confused with a sense of actual [sleepiness](https://effectindex.com/effects/sleepiness) as it is more comparable to feeling extremely heavy and unable to move one's body. Alongside of this, the user will likely feel a sense of persistent [dry mouth](https://effectindex.com/effects/dry-mouth) or [mild dehydration](https://effectindex.com/effects/dehydration) that often requires periodic sipping of water to keep it from reaching significant levels of discomfort.\n\nVarious adverse effects such as itching and rashes may also occur at this dosage range and above. Although it is uncommon, it is worth noting that a certain percentage of people seem to experience [itchiness](https://effectindex.com/effects/itchiness) on DXM that is comparable to that which occurs on opioids such morphine, kratom, and heroin. This is colloquially referred to as a \"robo itch\" within the DXM community and is likely a result of histamine release. \n\nIn terms of auditory perception, the clarity of sound itself may seem as if it has become [vague, muffled, and distant](https://effectindex.com/effects/auditory-suppression). Nonetheless, one's sense of [music appreciation](https://effectindex.com/effects/increased-music-appreciation) will have profoundly increased.  \n\nRegarding visual effects, some inconsistent and brief distortions may also occur spontaneously during dissociative experiences. These distortions can include alterations in perceived distances between objects, visual segmentation of one's vision into glitch-like [cubes](https://effectindex.com/effects/environmental-cubism) or [slices](https://effectindex.com/effects/scenery-slicing), and changes to the perceived size of one's body or the environment.\n\nDuring this level, if one allows themselves to relax while closing their eyes, they may find that they are fleetingly and partially drifting off into a [darkened hallucinatory void](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids) filled with vague [psychedelic geometry](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry) alongside simplistic [shapes, forms, and structures](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures). This is usually a very brief and indistinct experience, which can quickly be interrupted by external stimuli such as noises or other distractions.\n\nWith DXM in particular, it is worth noting that its [geometry](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry) is typically much more distinct, colourful, pronounced, and psychedelic-esque in comparison to that of other more commonly used dissociatives. Although it does not usually extend beyond level 5 geometry and is not entirely on par with a typical psychedelic in terms of complexity, it can often come very close in terms of its intensity, colour palette, and vividness. This effect will typically begin to manifest at this level subtly, and its intensity increases proportional to the dosage consumed. It can be comprehensively described through its [style variations](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry?s=variations) as *intricate in complexity, algorithmic in style, unstructured in organization, brightly lit in lighting, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, small in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity*.\n\nThere is also a distinct possibility that the user may experience stereotypical psychedelic drifting which causes the environment to appear to warp, morph, bend, and flow. However, although this effect is more common on DXM in comparison to that of other more common dissociatives, it is still substantially less common in comparison to that of a traditional psychedelic. The [style variations of this drifting](https://effectindex.com/effects/drifting?s=variations) are simple in complexity, slow-moving, smooth in perceived framerate, constant throughout, and unrealistic in its appearance.\n\nDepending on the person's level of experience with this substance, these effects can be allowed to occupy a predominant role within the person's perception, or they may be partially ignored and made somewhat secondary to other chosen activities.\n\nThis level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[third plateau](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.7)\".

disconnection](https://effectindex.com/categories/disconnective-effects) has begun to completely block out the user's perception of the external environment. It is here where the person may find themselves undergoing an out-of-body experience as they float in a variety of directions and orientations through a \"[dissociative hole](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids)\", which can be described as an expansive darkened void containing a wide array of [internal hallucinations](https://effectindex.com/effects/internal-hallucination) and [structures](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures). These structures are usually formed from solid materials which can take the form of any shape. Common examples include *vast and monolithic pillars, columns, walls, tunnels, blocks, buildings, slides, monuments, wheels, pyramids, caverns, and a variety of abstract or fractal shapes*. \n\nThe internal hallucinations that occur at this level will usually consist of vivid, ever-changing dream-like scenes and imagery. They can be comprehensively described through their [style variations](https://effectindex.com/effects/internal-hallucination?s=variations) as a combination of *lucid and delirious in awareness, fixed in style, primarily novel experiences over everyday or biographical content, autonomous in interactivity, and with a combination of both realistic and geometry based visual styles*.\n\nAlthough they are substantially less common than [internal hallucinations](https://effectindex.com/effects/internal-hallucination), [external hallucinations](https://effectindex.com/effects/external-hallucination) can also occasionally occur at heavy dosages of DXM. These are typically deliriant-like in nature and consist of solid hallucinations of objects or people blending seamlessly into the external environment. The most common theme seems to be the hallucination of conversing with other people in the environment who were not actually present throughout the trip. However, it is important to note that despite this effect being more common under the influence of DXM in comparison to that of other dissociatives, it is still quite rare and may never be experienced even by regular users.\n\nAlongside these disconnective hallucinatory effects, the user may experience feelings of altered cognition that feel as if they direct one's thought stream towards topics of [introspection](https://effectindex.com/effects/introspection), an [analysis of the details of their life](https://effectindex.com/effects/analysis-enhancement), and a general sense of [spiritual or philosophical contemplation](https://effectindex.com/effects/spirituality-enhancement).\n\nThis is the level at which the effects become powerful enough to render the person undergoing them as [incapable of functioning, interacting normally, or thinking in a sober manner](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids). At this level, the effects of the substance are apparent and can no longer be ignored in any capacity, leaving the user entirely engaged in the experience whether they wish to be or not. In terms of how this looks from an outsiders perspective, the person will usually appear to be either heavily sedated or almost entirely unconscious.\n\nThis level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to the lower end of a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[fourth plateau](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.7)\".

This leads into a state which is commonly referred to as \"[ego death](https://effectindex.com/effects/ego-death)\" due to the way in which the person completely loses their ability to recall and comprehend their own sense of identity.\n\nThis state of ego loss is accompanied by extremely [vivid hallucinatory voids](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids), [structures](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures), [geometric forms](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry), sensory disconnection, [internal hallucinations](https://effectindex.com/effects/internal-hallucination), [delusions](https://effectindex.com/effects/delusion), and occasionally life-changing spiritual or [transpersonal experiences](https://effectindex.com/categories/transpersonal-states).  \n\nIt is worth noting that during this dosage range, feelings of sudden [anxiety](https://effectindex.com/effects/anxiety), panic, or even an impending sense of doom can spontaneously occur at any point throughout the trip for no discernible reason. Although this is relatively uncommon, it can occur regardless of the users level of experience and can even suddenly manifest during the offset of the drug when the person has begun to feel almost entirely sober. This experience typically lasts any where from thirty minutes to a couple of hours, and seems more likely to manifest for people who use this substance on a regular basis.\n\nThis level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to the upper end of a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[fourth plateau](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.7)\". The specific distinct effects which generally occur at this level of intensity are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, listed below.}\n##md{#### Sensory\n* [**After

occurs when a person [loses all sensory awareness](https://effectindex.com/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids) and semblance of normal cognitive functioning. This renders the person unconscious and consistently leaves extended gaps in a person’s memory with large periods of [amnesia](https://effectindex.com/effects/amnesia) which are generally impossible to recall once the experience is over. It is at this level of dissociation that other dissociative substances such as ketamine are used in medical procedures for their anaesthetic effects.\n\nAt this dosage range, the person will experience the effects typically associated with the previously described level during the onset and offset of their trip. During the peak, however, they will black out and become unconscious for a prolonged period of time that is directly proportional to the dosage consumed.\n\nAlthough this extreme dissociative state may be attractive to certain individuals, it is worth noting that this level of intensity is not only potentially dangerous but also less therapeutic and exploratory than the previous levels. With DXM in particular, it is said by sites such as [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_dose.shtml) that dosages between 2,500 mg and 20,000 mg are capable of resulting in death. However, this seems unusually high to me, and I would not personally be surprised if dosages closer to 1000mg were capable of causing a fatal overdose within certain individuals that have either a lower body weight or a higher sensitivity.}\n##headered-textbox|label=\"Level 7\"|header=\"Prolonged\"|labelBackground=\"#555554\"|headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"{This state of DXM is not necessarily the highest level of the substances potential intensity but is qualitatively different from that of the previously listed levels. This state is induced by taking successive doses of DXM over several hours, instead of a single dose. It is reported to intensify many aspects of the DXM experience, and often produces more vivid and disorientating [external hallucinations](https://effectindex.com/effects/external-hallucination), [autonomous entity](https://effectindex.com/effects/autonomous-entity) contact, [delirium](https://effectindex.com/effects/delirium), [anxiety](https://effectindex.com/effects/anxiety), [delusions](https://effectindex.com/effects/delusion), [psychosis](https://effectindex.com/effects/psychosis) and many other extremely unpleasant side effects. \n\nWithin the DXM community it is colloquially referred to as \"plateau sigma\" and was originally described in Erowid's 2002 [DXM FAQ](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.9). It is usually achieved using the following technique:\n\n1. Take a weak \"second plateau\" dosage at approximately 200-400 mg. It is recommended to do this earlier in the day due to the lengthiness of this process, as sleep deprivation or fatigue can negatively impact the experience.\n2. After approximately three hours (or about one hour after the peak) take another weak \"second plateau\" dosage.\n3. After another three hours (or about one hour after the second peak) take either a strong \"second plateau\" or a weak \"third plateau\" dosage at approximately 400-600mg.\n4. During the offset of this third dosage, the user may find themselves experiencing \"plateau sigma\" instead of slowly returning to baseline.\n\n\nHowever, it is important to note that within the DXM community, this experience is widely considered extremely unpleasant and potentially dangerous. There are seemingly very few cases of people who enjoy this state of mind. Because of these factors, it is universally advised that people avoid experimenting with it altogether.}"

DMT is not active through oral ingestion unless an MAOI or an RIMA (such as syrian rue or B. caapi vine) is consumed approximately 30 - 60 minutes prior to DMT. This substantially changes the subjective effect profile of the compound, so much that it is usually discussed as distinct experience: “Ayahuasca” is DMT prepared for oral ingestion using traditional plant sources, while “pharmahuasca” colloquially refers to preparations made with crystalized DMT or psychiatric MAOIs. \n\nBesides vaporizing and oral ingestion, less effective (and consequently less common) routes of administration include insufflation, rectal suppository, and sublingual absorption. In clinical settings, DMT is typically administered intravenously, which can allowed for a prolonged immersive hallucinatory state. Recreational intravenous use is also uncommon as it requires medical equipment, training, and pharmaceutical-grade DMT.\n\nThe duration of a DMT trip seems to progress through four separate stages of experience that each feel distinct. At heavy dosages the user may find themselves progressing through all of these stages in sequence, while low-dose experiences may skip over stages 2 or 3. These stages are described and documented below.\n\n##headered-textbox|label=\"Level 1\"|header=\"Taking off\"|labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\"|headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"{The first stage of a DMT trip is the onset, which leads into what is commonly referred to as \"breaking through\". \n\nAs the user smokes DMT, effects typically begins with the sudden onset of distinct [visual enhancements](https://effectindex.com/categories/visual-enhancements), which are immediately followed by high-level [geometry](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry) and a [warm tingling sensation](https://effectindex.com/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations). At higher dosages, the user may find the pipe that they are using to smoke their DMT has transformed into an incomprehensible mass of geometry that is quite difficult to put down or hand off to someone nearby.

The user typically feels like they have broken through into the hallucinatory [DMT space](https://effectindex.com/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes), as described above in the \"other side\" section. \n\nFor most people, a strong dose of DMT will produce high-level [internal hallucinations](https://effectindex.com/effects/internal-hallucination) more consistently than any other psychedelic. The [style variations of these internal hallucinations] is that they are usually *lucid in awareness, interactive, novel in subject, autonomous and non-controllable, and psychedelic in appearance*. This is accompanied by other hallucinatory effects such as [autonomous entities](https://effectindex.com/effects/autonomous-entity), [sceneries and landscapes](https://effectindex.com/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes), and [narrative scenarios](https://effectindex.com/effects/scenarios-and-plots). These hallucinations can involve an endless variety of themes that may be personal, religious, spiritual, futuristic, magical, surreal, nonsensical, or transcendental in nature.\n\nHowever, it is also worth mentioning that during the onset of this intensity range and above, the user will often experiences [changes in their perception of gravity](https://effectindex.com/effects/changes-in-felt-gravity) which commonly involve feelings of floating at extreme speeds either forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards, or in an unspecifiable direction. This will usually stop once the user has reached their \"destination\" but will often continue at a much slower pace if the hallucination involves moving around within a specific location.\n\nAlthough they are substantially less common than internal hallucinations, [external hallucinations](https://effectindex.com/effects/external-hallucination) can also occasionally occur with heavy doses of DMT. These typically consist of a mixture of realistic and [geometry](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry)-based hallucinations of either real objects within the surrounding environment \"[coming to life](https://effectindex.com/effects/object-activation)\", the entirety of the environment changing in its visual character, or sudden apparitions such as the appearance of [autonomous entities](https://effectindex.com/effects/autonomous-entity). The [style variations](https://effectindex.com/effects/external-hallucination?s=variations) of these external hallucinations is *lucid awareness, an immersed viewpoint, novel subject matter, autonomous and non-controllable, and equally likely to be either realistic in appearance or comprised of psychedelic geometry*. Although external hallucinations are more common under the influence of DMT in comparison to other psychedelics, they are still quite uncommon and may never be experienced even by regular users.\n\nDespite intense hallucinations at this dosage range, the user will often still feel connected to their physical body even while traversing [hallucinatory spaces](https://effectindex.com/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes). Most users will  automatically close their eyes and allowing themselves to be immersed in the internal experience – however, if the user suddenly opens their eyes midway through the trip, they will likely leave the hallucinatory space. Upon interrupting their [internal hallucinations](https://effectindex.com/effects/internal-hallucination), the user will typically experience much less-intense [visual effects](https://effectindex.com/categories/visual-effects) with their eyes open. These effects typically include strong [visual distortions](https://effectindex.com/categories/visual-distortions) and highly complex [geometry](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry) that almost completely cover the user's field of view. Upon closing their eyes again, the user may find themselves placed directly back into the same [hallucinatory scenario](https://effectindex.com/effects/scenarios-and-plots), or they may simply experience high-level geometry while being unable to completely re-enter their internal hallucination.\n\nDuring less intense DMT breakthroughs experienced at this dosage range, many users report feeling surprisingly lucid and clear-headed in comparison to an equally-intense dose of psilocybin, mescaline, or LSD. However, the insightful and therapeutic cognitive effects that are heavily associated with psychedelic experiences are frequently either entirely absent or significantly reduced. This may be a result of DMT's extremely short duration, which does not allow the person much time to deeply contemplate or experience its cognitive effects.\n\nIf the user is inexperienced with psychedelic substances while undergoing this dosage range or above, they may find themselves experiencing [anxiety](https://effectindex.com/effects/anxiety) and fear throughout the duration of the trip. This is not because DMT is inherently anxiety-inducing, but is more likely a response to being thrust into a profoundly complex, bizarre, overwhelming, and unfamiliar situation. As with any hallucinogen, it is always safest to slowly increase an inexperienced person's dosage in small increments over the course of multiple trips, and at a rate which the user is comfortable with. \n\nA strong DMT experience is powerful enough to render the user mostly incapable of functioning normally, social interactions, or thinking in a sober manner. At this level of intensity, the effects of the substance are obvious and cannot be ignored in any capacity, leaving the user completely engaged in the experience whether they wish to be or not.\n\nIn terms of its stages, a strong DMT trip will usually result in all four stages of the experience, but with the \"other side\" being distinctly present  – although it will still become more defined at higher dosages.

These concepts can include everything from their name, hometown, memories, the awareness of being on drugs, what drugs even are, what human beings are, what life is, that time exists, what anything is, or that anything exists.\n\nDuring this state, the person will usually still experience typical hallucinatory content such as [scenery](https://effectindex.com/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes), imagery, [autonomous entity](https://effectindex.com/effects/autonomous-entity) contact, etc. However, the hallucinations may become even further defined in terms of their visual clarity and overall complexity. Alongside this, the content of these hallucinations may be significantly more likely to adopt themes that are commonly interpreted as being \"otherworldly\", \"transcendent\", or from a \"higher plane of existence\".  On the contrary, many people also report that at this level their hallucinations do not become better defined, but instead break down and become increasingly fast-moving, formless, rapidly shapeshifting, and incoherent.\n\nIn regards to the person's cognition and general state of mind at this level, there is a much higher likelihood of intense [transpersonal states](https://effectindex.com/categories/transpersonal-effects) and [spirituality experiences](https://effectindex.com/effects/spirituality-enhancement). These commonly include experiences such as feelings of inextricable [unity between oneself and the rest of existence](https://effectindex.com/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness), metaphysical insights into the supposed nature of reality, and feelings of deep spiritual reverence towards the universe as a whole.\n\nA heavy DMT experience is the level at which the practical upper limit of what the substance is capable of producing is reached.

Compared to the [style of geometry](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry?s=variations) produced by ayahuasca, the geometry appears more synthetic and digital in material composition, demonstrates colour schemes that are similar to those experienced on LSD, and has an organized geometric structure reminiscent of that produced by psilocybin.\\n\\nAt this level, spontaneous tactile sensations become pronounced and fully manifested. The [style variations of these bodily sensations](https://effectindex.com/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations?s=variations) includes *a constant duration, feelings of movement, gentle character, all-encompassing placement, and euphoric emotion*. This sensation typically maintains a consistent presence that quickly rises with the onset and hits a limit once the peak has been reached. It is capable of becoming very powerful at higher doses and can sometimes persist for up to half an hour after the experience itself has ended.\\n\\nDuring a distinct DMT experience, the effects and the nature of the substance become well-defined enough that ignoring its effects is difficult. However, the user is still enough in control to be able to just about partake in normal behaviours, remain functional, and be able to communicate. Depending on the person's level of experience, the effects can be allowed dominate the user’s perception, or they may be ignored and made secondary to other chosen activities.\\n\\nAt most, a distinct DMT trip may result in a well-defined \\\"take off\\\" followed by an ill-defined version of the \\\"waiting room\\\", while entirely skipping over stage three.

The user typically feels like they have broken through into the hallucinatory [DMT space](https://effectindex.com/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes), as described above in the \\\"other side\\\" section. \\n\\nFor most people, a strong dose of DMT will produce high-level [internal hallucinations](https://effectindex.com/effects/internal-hallucination) more consistently than any other psychedelic. The [style variations of these internal hallucinations] is that they are usually *lucid in awareness, interactive, novel in subject, autonomous and non-controllable, and psychedelic in appearance*. This is accompanied by other hallucinatory effects such as [autonomous entities](https://effectindex.com/effects/autonomous-entity), [sceneries and landscapes](https://effectindex.com/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes), and [narrative scenarios](https://effectindex.com/effects/scenarios-and-plots). These hallucinations can involve an endless variety of themes that may be personal, religious, spiritual, futuristic, magical, surreal, nonsensical, or transcendental in nature.\\n\\nHowever, it is also worth mentioning that during the onset of this intensity range and above, the user will often experiences [changes in their perception of gravity](https://effectindex.com/effects/changes-in-felt-gravity) which commonly involve feelings of floating at extreme speeds either forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards, or in an unspecifiable direction. This will usually stop once the user has reached their \\\"destination\\\" but will often continue at a much slower pace if the hallucination involves moving around within a specific location.\\n\\nAlthough they are substantially less common than internal hallucinations, [external hallucinations](https://effectindex.com/effects/external-hallucination) can also occasionally occur with heavy doses of DMT. These typically consist of a mixture of realistic and [geometry](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry)-based hallucinations of either real objects within the surrounding environment \\\"[coming to life](https://effectindex.com/effects/object-activation)\\\", the entirety of the environment changing in its visual character, or sudden apparitions such as the appearance of [autonomous entities](https://effectindex.com/effects/autonomous-entity). The [style variations](https://effectindex.com/effects/external-hallucination?s=variations) of these external hallucinations is *lucid awareness, an immersed viewpoint, novel subject matter, autonomous and non-controllable, and equally likely to be either realistic in appearance or comprised of psychedelic geometry*. Although external hallucinations are more common under the influence of DMT in comparison to other psychedelics, they are still quite uncommon and may never be experienced even by regular users.\\n\\nDespite intense hallucinations at this dosage range, the user will often still feel connected to their physical body even while traversing [hallucinatory spaces](https://effectindex.com/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes). Most users will  automatically close their eyes and allowing themselves to be immersed in the internal experience – however, if the user suddenly opens their eyes midway through the trip, they will likely leave the hallucinatory space. Upon interrupting their [internal hallucinations](https://effectindex.com/effects/internal-hallucination), the user will typically experience much less-intense [visual effects](https://effectindex.com/categories/visual-effects) with their eyes open. These effects typically include strong [visual distortions](https://effectindex.com/categories/visual-distortions) and highly complex [geometry](https://effectindex.com/effects/geometry) that almost completely cover the user's field of view. Upon closing their eyes again, the user may find themselves placed directly back into the same [hallucinatory scenario](https://effectindex.com/effects/scenarios-and-plots), or they may simply experience high-level geometry while being unable to completely re-enter their internal hallucination.\\n\\nDuring less intense DMT breakthroughs experienced at this dosage range, many users report feeling surprisingly lucid and clear-headed in comparison to an equally-intense dose of psilocybin, mescaline, or LSD. However, the insightful and therapeutic cognitive effects that are heavily associated with psychedelic experiences are frequently either entirely absent or significantly reduced. This may be a result of DMT's extremely short duration, which does not allow the person much time to deeply contemplate or experience its cognitive effects.\\n\\nIf the user is inexperienced with psychedelic substances while undergoing this dosage range or above, they may find themselves experiencing [anxiety](https://effectindex.com/effects/anxiety) and fear throughout the duration of the trip. This is not because DMT is inherently anxiety-inducing, but is more likely a response to being thrust into a profoundly complex, bizarre, overwhelming, and unfamiliar situation. As with any hallucinogen, it is always safest to slowly increase an inexperienced person's dosage in small increments over the course of multiple trips, and at a rate which the user is comfortable with. \\n\\nA strong DMT experience is powerful enough to render the user mostly incapable of functioning normally, social interactions, or thinking in a sober manner. At this level of intensity, the effects of the substance are obvious and cannot be ignored in any capacity, leaving the user completely engaged in the experience whether they wish to be or not.\\n\\nIn terms of its stages, a strong DMT trip will usually result in all four stages of the experience, but with the \\\"other side\\\" being distinctly present  – although it will still become more defined at higher dosages.

The profound ease through which it can reliably transport the majority of people into incomprehensibly complex hallucinatory states is perhaps completely unmatched within the world of hallucinogenic compounds. However, it is because of these capabilities that this substance has developed a reputation which is surrounded by misconceptions and cultural mysticism that I feel the need to address within this section directly.\n\nFor example, the claims that DMT is released by the pineal gland during birth, death, and dreaming are entirely unfounded by the scientific literature. This idea was first popularised by the Richard Strassman's book \"The spirit molecule\" in which it was stated as pure speculation more so than as an evidence-backed theory. Although it is true that DMT is found in trace amounts within a vast number of plants and animals (including humans), there is absolutely no evidence that it is specifically produced by the pineal gland or that it is released in psychedelic amounts during certain situations. In fact, the current scientific consensus regarding the prevalence of DMT within plants and animals seems to suggest that it is most likely a byproduct of biological processes that are entirely unrelated to that of the pineal gland.\n\nIn regards to the specific claim that the neurological mechanism responsible for dream states is due to the pineal gland releasing DMT during REM sleep, I think it is worth mentioning my position that the people who believe this have it completely backwards. In my opinion, it's not that normal sleeping dream states occur because endogenous DMT is being released, but that waking dream states are temporarily induced when dosages of DMT and other psychedelics are ingested which are strong enough to cause the specific subjective effect known as internal hallucinations. \n\nMy reasoning behind this is that there are some interesting commonalities between the behaviour of psychedelic induced hallucinations and dreaming that are too prevalent to discount as purely coincidental. For example, the four-tier levelling systems which I have devised for both internal hallucinations and autonomous entity contact communication can both be applied perfectly to dreams and dream character communication in a manner which does not require any substantial changes to their descriptions. Alongside of this, the amnesia that is commonly experienced during the offset of a DMT experience behaves identically to that of the amnesia which is frequently experienced after waking up from a dream. Last of all and in a more subjective sense, the general feeling of a DMT hallucination feels very dreamlike to me and is commonly described as such by many people.\n\nWhile there are some apparent aesthetic and behavioural differences between that of psychedelic internal hallucinations and normal dream states, in my opinion, these can be accounted for by the simultaneous occurrence of other subjective effects alongside these high-level internal hallucinations. For example, the simultaneous experience of psychedelic geometry during a hallucinatory state seems to result in it appearing to be physically comprised of ever-shifting and incomprehensibly complex condensed geometric forms in a manner which gives them their well known \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. In terms of their behaviour, however, the simultaneous experience of an incredibly wide range of cognitive states such as ego death and various transpersonal effects seem to synergise and interplay with the specific effect of internal hallucinations in a manner which results in them displaying themes and concepts which would not ordinarily occur during normal dream states.\n\nAnother even more outlandish although less common claim is that DMT literally transports the user's consciousness to an alternate dimension or higher plane of transcendental existence in which the autonomous entities are it's real and living inhabitants. While this idea has likely been around for as long as DMT has been used by human beings, it was seemingly popularised by Terence Mckenna and his recounts of visiting \"machine elves\" within what he claimed was a real space which legitimately existed somewhere outside of the human subconscious. From his perspective, McKenna hypothesised that the DMT was potentially an access point to a parallel universe, a tool through which extraterrestrials use to communicate with us, a space in which human beings from the future reside, or an afterlife which contains an \"ecology of souls\" of previously living and unborn ancestral spirits.\n\nOn some level, I can definitely empathise with these perspectives as it is easy for me to see how a person could come to these conclusions given how absolutely incomprehensible and profound many DMT experiences can be. However, it is still worth noting that for a variety of different reasons, these conclusions almost definitely arise as a result of undergoing the DMT experience without a general understanding of occums razor, critical thinking, and scepticism.  While these various forms of misinformation may seem relatively harmless, I would argue that spreading them as fact is harmful to our community as it gives people the impression that psychedelic users are irrational proponents of pseudoscientific ideas.}",

Last of all and in a more subjective sense, the general feeling of a DMT hallucination feels very dreamlike to me and is commonly described as such by many people.\\n\\nWhile there are some apparent aesthetic and behavioural differences between that of psychedelic internal hallucinations and normal dream states, in my opinion, these can be accounted for by the simultaneous occurrence of other subjective effects alongside these high-level internal hallucinations. For example, the simultaneous experience of psychedelic geometry during a hallucinatory state seems to result in it appearing to be physically comprised of ever-shifting and incomprehensibly complex condensed geometric forms in a manner which gives them their well known \\\"hyperspatial\\\" aesthetic. In terms of their behaviour, however, the simultaneous experience of an incredibly wide range of cognitive states such as ego death and various transpersonal effects seem to synergise and interplay with the specific effect of internal hallucinations in a manner which results in them displaying themes and concepts which would not ordinarily occur during normal dream states.\\n\\nAnother even more outlandish although less common claim is that DMT literally transports the user's consciousness to an alternate dimension or higher plane of transcendental existence in which the autonomous entities are it's real and living inhabitants. While this idea has likely been around for as long as DMT has been used by human beings, it was seemingly popularised by Terence Mckenna and his recounts of visiting \\\"machine elves\\\" within what he claimed was a real space which legitimately existed somewhere outside of the human subconscious. From his perspective, McKenna hypothesised that the DMT was potentially an access point to a parallel universe, a tool through which extraterrestrials use to communicate with us, a space in which human beings from the future reside, or an afterlife which contains an \\\"ecology of souls\\\" of previously living and unborn ancestral spirits.\\n\\nOn some level, I can definitely empathise with these perspectives as it is easy for me to see how a person could come to these conclusions given how absolutely incomprehensible and profound many DMT experiences can be. However, it is still worth noting that for a variety of different reasons, these conclusions almost definitely arise as a result of undergoing the DMT experience without a general understanding of occums razor, critical thinking, and scepticism.  While these various forms of misinformation may seem relatively harmless, I would argue that spreading them as fact is harmful to our community as it gives people the impression that psychedelic users are irrational proponents of pseudoscientific ideas.\"}]",
