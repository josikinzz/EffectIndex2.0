The visual effects are disproportionately powerful in relation to the accompanying physical and cognitive effects. I am experiencing no nausea, anxiety, disorientation, delusions, etc, and yet I am breaking through into level 7 geometry. However, it’s worth noting that despite the intensity of this geometry, upon closer analysis the patterns are very simplistic, repetitive and shallow in their detail. They contain no hallucinatory imagery whatsoever.\n \nAlthough I am not disorientated, I am experiencing many cognitive suppressions such as analysis suppression, short-term memory loss, language suppression, etc. I am also uncontrollably laughing at minor things, sweating profusely from my hands, streaming from my eyes, salivating from my mouth, and phelgming from my throat at a level of intensity which I have not experienced on any other psychedelic.\n \nThroughout this, I am experiencing cognitive enhancement and suppression cycles which continued for the rest of the day. During this state, I spend an approximately 10-20 minute period feeling incredibly stimulated and inspired, followed by another 10-20 minute cycle of feeling sedated and brain dead. It feels as if my brain is putting all of its energy into running at maximum efficiency, only to run out of steam after a short period and need to recuperate until it regains the strength to repeat this process.\n \nI am experiencing therapeutic introspection regarding taking better care of my health, improving the passability of my voice, and being a kinder, more honest, and less selfish person. I thought about my girlfriends and understood how lucky I am to be in long-term relationships with two people I love dearly and who love me back."

        "description": " I lay on the sofa in this state, shifting between staring out the window at the trees and talking to my friend about some of his personal issues. At some point during this conversation, I spontaneously get the feeling that something has “clicked”, that I am no longer looking at my life through the perspective of “Josie” but am now instead looking at my life through the perspective of all of existence. I suddenly feel that I am literally the universe experiencing itself and engaging with itself through organisms within it that are evolved enough to be capable of observing and interacting with their surroundings. I notice how it feels like this state of being is a distinct node or point in spacetime that is somehow directly connected back through a “window in time” to the last trip I experienced this state of mind during, which was over four years ago.\n \nAt first, I feel an overwhelming sense of peace and stillness, but after what felt like several minutes I begin to feel nervous. I felt as if this sensation was something that countless people have spent their entire lives meditating over for the chance of merely catching a glimpse of it. I felt that this state of mind had extreme historical and philosophical significance and that people throughout history had likely formed entire religions around this experience. I knew that I was incredibly fortunate to experience it, so much so that this was one of the most significant events that had ever occurred to me.\n \nDuring this state, I got the sensation that the universe is not a collection of disjointed concepts and labels, but a truly unified system of behaviour, each part of which was interconnected with and interdependent upon the greater whole. This meant that human beings do not see things as they are, but instead separate their environment into symbolic subconcepts and labels to such an extent that they “forget” the actual state of affairs and come to the illusion that they are a separate agent approaching an \"external\" environment.\n \nAccompanying all of this, I also had the sensation that the separateness of time was yet another illusion. I felt that the history of existence wasn’t a present moment with a past that was no longer occurring and a future which has yet to have happened, but instead was a collection of simultaneously occurring events which were merely points along a “map” in a physical direction. This feeling led me to the conclusion that although a person does not live a life which is a long as the history of existence as a whole, their finite lifespan continues to occur infinitely within their own time frame.\n \nAs I laid on the sofa with all these thoughts flowing through me, I realised that I needed to pee. However, I did not want to change my environment and instead wanted to lay there and continue to experience this state of high-level unity. I genuinely considered pissing my pants before stating aloud that as a physical point of existence, I should not give into decay as to do so was to was to accept dissolution and to surrender to entropy. I felt that for better or worse, I must therefore always choose to engage with my environment instead of just ignoring it.\n \nWhen I started engaging with the environment, I could feel the effects of unity fade, and I started looking at the world from the perspective of Josie instead of existence as a whole. However, I laid back down after peeing, and the feeling quickly returned in full force. I requested that our Amazon Alexa play ripple by the Grateful Dead and quietly wept tears of joy to the lyrics. After this, I looked outside at the trees and felt incredibly grateful to be alive. \n\nMy friend started randomly talking to me about some work stuff involving the taxi system that Lyft is competing within Seattle; I couldn’t comprehend a word that he said due to my loss of short-term memory. However, I listened closely as I felt that I was hearing the sounds of society and that although it would usually be considered trivial during my egotistical states of normality, In my current state, I felt that it was beautiful. \n\nI felt that consciousness was a universal aspect of existence that was present within all systems to varying degrees no matter how simplistic. The function of the universe was therfore a perfect conscious process which through its own imagination, had somehow designed itself as a system of exponentially increasing self-complexification. I felt that within the known universe at least, human civilisation was the most significant point of complexity that it had so far reached. I, therefore, concluded that we should be striving not to destroy ourselves and to continue the momentum of this process ever onward into wherever it may lead us. This should be done not just for ourselves but for the universe as a whole.\n \nAfter this, I sat there for what felt like an hour or so simply looking out the window and feeling blown away by what I had just experienced."

    "conclusion": "I am incredibly lucky to have experienced this state, especially from the vantage point of a human being which is less indoctrinated into mystical and religious thinking than the average person. I will spend the next few days, weeks and months analysing this state of mind to try and draw what conclusions from it that I can.\n \nI am not sure that taking any other psychedelic today would have made a difference in regards to experiencing unity. 4-HO-MET does not seem like the type of substance that is more likely to induce this state over any others; it seemed that instead, the occurrence of this state was far more dependent on circumstance and setting in a complex and subtle way that I am not sure if I will ever fully understand.\n\nThanks for reading.",

When I took this dose I had recently accidentally overdosed on 200mg of DMT in an ayahuasca brew, which was a pretty traumatic experience. I am very stressed about many different aspects in my life (my health, financial security, family health, work stuff, etc) and having minor PTSD flashbacks to the ayahuasca experience. I would rate my depression intensity at 8.5/10 prior to dosing.",

It was distinctly more colourful and clear-headed in comparison to that of other dissociatives such as ketamine, MXE, DCK, and 3-MeO-PCP.\n\nI began thinking intensely about my place within the universe and within the history of this species. I was feeling strong feelings of spiritual reverence and a profound appreciation for being alive. As I drifted through the void, my stream of consciousness started analysing my philosophical viewpoints on what was right and wrong in this world. It seemed to conclude that the universe is a neutral process with no right/wrong or better/worse unless a sentient-being applies those intellectual constructs to parts of it. I was also getting existential self-realisation and felt as if I was \"waking up\" while re-remembering who I was and what I wanted to do with my life. I felt that subjective effect documentation was the most direct way through which I could contribute to this civilisation as it would hopefully assist in legitimising and spreading the social acceptance of undergoing these incredibly beneficial states."

    "conclusion": "I purchased this DXM on a whim because I understood that it is a readily available classical hallucinogen that requires documentation. I was expecting to feel subtly dissociated for the evening and to derp around while watching a movie or something. Instead, I received a profound sense of spiritual reverence with shockingly profound cognitive and visual effects that easily rivalled the more mainstream psychedelics and dissociatives. Considering what it is capable of inducing, It is really hard to believe that this substance is both legal and so freely available to the general public.\n\nThis is a truly underappreciated compound with a unique pharmacology that needs to be re-evaluated by the mainstream psychonaut community. It does not feel comparable to any other dissociative and is incredibly psychedelic. I would class this substance as a psychedelic dissociative more so than merely one or the other.\n\nAlthough this was far from my first trip with this substance, it has been around six years since I have tripped on DXM. I recall having amazing experiences with it as a teenager but had somehow forgotten about this substance entirely. I now feel even more inspired to revisit the dozens of hallucinogens which I am experienced with because as an adult with a standardised methodology for documenting them, the experiences are in many ways even more profound.\n\nThanks for reading.",

It hits the back of my throat and instantly triggers coughing, shattering me with an itching discomfort. Tears stream of my eyes and the pain sets in. What caught me off guard was just how instant it was. 2C-B gives you a split second to think about what you’ve done before exploding into a cacophony of pain. 2C-C is heftier burn, like a bonfire, virtue of the sheer quantity of it that needs to be insufflated. 2C-I is more a slow burn, a smoldering ember gradually and slowly setting in. But this, this was as quick as could be, instant, unrelenting, unforgiving pain.\nTo my relief, the pain eventually gives away to a throbbing numbness. Perhaps this is the maximum capacity for pain without any tangible physical source that my body has. I am content with that.

The sensory aspect of the trip has been developing more and more. The visuals now consist of large forms, not arranged in any consistent overall pattern, but rather forming an organic sort of landscape. They give the illusion of a receding depth of field and are adorned with intricate designs, more fractal and algorithmic than the forms that contain them. Delicate radial traceries adorn the infinite geometric fields that are embossed onto my vision, iridescent colors flashing at their borders like an ornate relief catching prismatic sunlight. The patterns blossom like plants, larger veins fractalizing into more intricate capillaries. My thoughts are scattered and stimulated, I find it hard to focus on any one thing and am constantly jumping between tasks (the tasks being browsing various pages on the internet and taking notes mostly)."

The second was how short it was- it was fast, intense, pretty uncomfortable, but passed into nothing fairly quickly. Overall it felt very standard and inconsequential, just a brief foray into psychedelia with somewhat standard visuals. The bodyload was offputting though. There was none of that cognitively stimulating afterglow that came with dosing the same chemical orally also.  ",

At other times it feels as though I feel the opposite, cramped and tightly tucked into my little room. The shifts come randomly in no discernible pattern, it’s just different strands and streams of thought competing for attention. It is an odd sensation that does not entirely make sense, but seems to harmoniously accompany a burgeoning sense of confusion. When I close my eyes it is hard to open them again, as though they have locked shut. I find myself falling into trances and periods of stasis, it is like my consciousness is slipping away without me noticing, it feels like I am nodding off."

I am sinking and being pulled down and folded over and tucked in, with metal bars spanning my thoughts and keeping me in place. Towering temples are caressing my existence with iridescent beams and trusses, adorned with glowing oozing gardens. The entire feeling is that of oozing, drooping, leaking, suffocating under a fluid weight. It feels like I am drowning in flower petals and being hit with a train simultaneously. My memory and consciousness and sense of linear existence have been betrayed into ephemerality- every breath I takes feels like waking up from a long nap; I exhale and fall back into the infinite endless hole; I inhale and I am back. It’s jarring and disorienting, unsettling and dizzying. Large looming patterns and large shapes splatter and scatter my mind, aerosolized into a phosphorescent mist. I am a statue, held still at odd angles at the mercy of gravity, my skull is throbbing and lurking and pulsing, it feels like my head is being smeared. I feel so smothered and enveloped, so blurry and blank and fuzzy, as if my entire existence is lo-fidelity. Everything I can see with my open eyes looks washed out, overexposed, and faded. I haven’t moved or stood up for a good bit now, my jaw can only hang open, I can only be numb. I am incapacitated beyond words."

    "conclusion": "Unlike every other exclusively 3-substituted arylcyclohexamine I’ve tried, (3-HO-PCE, 3-MeO-PCE, 3-MeO-PCP), this was not functional or stimulating in the least. It was a powerful, all encompassing, annihilating experience that thrashed me about like a raft in a hurricane. I was wholly incapacitated and smothered with sheer dissociative intensity, a thrashing morass of all-consuming colors and forms. There were several things that stood out to me- First was the duration- the comeup was over an hour long, I am so so glad I didn’t attempt to redose. At ~10 mg, this is an extremely potent substance. Secondly was the recurring feeling of entirely fading in and out of consciousness, a sort of nodding. While many dissociatives lend this effect with respect to dipping in and out of the hole, this felt more like falling asleep or simply blacking out for brief islands of time. This could be troublesome in the wrong setting. Lastly was a persistent feeling of pressure, of being compressed, smothered, and impressed on at all sides. It was suffocating, though I knew I wasn’t actually in any danger the whole time. It was very reminiscent of mixing 3-MeO-PCP and 3-MeO-PCE in the sense that it was an overwhelming and relentless dissociative storm, but it lacked the stimulation and mania. It was an esoteric removal from reality.\n",

Their appendages are frilly and feathery, interlocking and overlapping to hold them all together in a harmonious tangle. Cognitively, the drug feels sedating and rather boring, there simply isn’t much to it. None of the rapidfire chains of thoughts or insatiable curiosity or calculating rationality, I am certainly not lucid or sober by any means, it’s just a dulled down mode of thought that almost seems to inhibit me from engaging in any task I may desire.\n"

I would find myself looking at the world in new ways, considering things from a more holistic perspective. Psychedelics usually make it entertaining just to sit there and do nothing. This however, offered no such concession- my idleness was a shadow looming above me, criticizing me for my inaction, for the fact that I dosed myself with something that sedated my mind to the point of impairment, that I wasted an afternoon that I could’ve spent doing something productive. It’s a feeling of psychedelic self-criticism that is marked by a scathing scorching harshness I had not felt since my days of exploring NBOMes in the depths of deep depressions. I am a wastrel, I am wasting precious time and precious energy doing nothing but sitting around on my laptop, not even doing something productive like learning, just sitting there.\nI feel like this should motivate me to get up and do things, to make the night more fulfilling, but I simply cannot. I just don’t have the interest or energy to attempt any task. I don’t want to just be lying here, but it’s all I can do.  "

This could perhaps be attributed to a particularly dull set and setting, though many psychedelics manage to make lying on my bed with my eyes closed for long periods of time entertaining and profound.

I try putting on all sorts of music. I’m not sure why, but I choose to listen to noise. I really don’t know why I do this, it doesn’t help anything, at all. In fact it feels like it is contributing to some psychosomatic landscape that is exacerbating the bodyload. Whatever, I do have a tendency to fuck with my own body. I curl into a ball on my bed, it’s the only comfort I can find, it feels like I am on a rocking boat. Emotionally, there is no euphoria, no depth or introspection even. There is a great deal of pondering the minute details of my stimuli, especially music. Music becomes pretty fascinating. I would love to try this one again with a healthier diet and maybe more melodic and harmonious music. The grinding discord, the disjointed cacophony and auditory fearmongering shreds me apart though.

I feel like I am reading too much into people’s body language and emotions, I am reading into things that just straight up aren’t there.

We go up to my room. They interact and I’m glad that I don’t have to do much. I show them some cool stuff I found recently. I take a dab. I smoke a bowl. I take another dab.

The muffled sounds of the world around me reverberate and blend together, each one colliding and spiraling off into infinity, birthing some new hybrid noise. I wander the plaza of the museum, marveling at the architecture and the beauty of its form, so carefully crafted.

The snow masks the individual steps, making this a harrowing journey. Each step feels like a separate journey, a new eternity that I have to cross. Thoughts race through my head of what could go wrong as I descend-I could fall and injure myself, I could get trapped in a horrific loop, I could get arrested (for whatever reason), I imagine myself in the back of a cop car, extremely confused, my thoughts looping through emotions of terror and utter devastation. I would later find out that my parents had been stalking my social media without my knowledge and I had been foolish enough to brag about this experience online. They later told me they had considered coming out to get me, something that would have likely been traumatic. Thankfully I make it safely to the bottom of the steps and begin my journey back towards center city. As this unfolds I am stricken by an intense déjà vu, as vivid memories of my dreams begin to dance in my head. It becomes hard to distinguish between real memories and the subconscious memories of my dreams. While walking down the boulevard, I become more entranced by what I identify as the real ones. Every memory I can imagine, blossoming off into another by slight relevance, like clicking through Wikipedia articles, each one vividly playing out before me within this short span of time. I did not necessarily relive them in a sensory way-though images of them would flash in the darkness behind the swirling snow and in my peripheral vision-rather I vividly experienced the emotions and mindset of each memory, as if I was there experiencing the way these things all made me feel. Beautiful, tear jerking nostalgia. I am reminded of how much work I have put into this life, amassing all these experiences. All the while the ground is pulsing and rippling and twitching with lines and ghost images of every conceivable color, depth perception is completely destroyed as double images begin to overcome my vision and spaces begin to shrink and expand in unpredictable and inconceivable ways. The snow obscures the border between road and sidewalk, along with the complex textures overlaying every surface, making navigation and walking very difficult. This comes along with fear of being hit by one of the many plows busily patrolling the streets and pushing the snow aside.\n"

I feel like I am a walking building-I am the city, the city is me, and we are both being crushed under the onslaught of winter’s wrath. I decide two things- one is that I really need to pee, two is that I want to go see Chinatown and its perpetual display of vibrant lights. I walk in that general direction. There are more road crews around city hall working tirelessly to keep the streets clear. I stop and rest in a tunnel and realize a predicament-how the hell am I getting home? Is the bus still running even? Oops, major mistake. I watch a person across the street sheltering in the tunnel and realize how lonely and desolate this place is. I wander out to street and realize I’m going in circles. This happens so often when I trip alone in the city, I get very hopelessly lost. Space means nothing and familiar landmarks are unrecognizable as everything gets drowned out in distortions and colors. I eventually find myself in Chinatown after much wandering and tripping and falling. I am becoming intolerably cold as my layers and bundles begin to falter to the constant wind and snow. Chinatown is glowing and beautiful, each building bathed in an aura of light as it catches the drifting crystals of ice. The buildings are intricate and beautiful, with so much detail and filth packed into every corner of my vision, all of it being buried and simplified under the blankets of snow. Teenagers are enjoying the night and taking pictures and laughing and joking. I feel pretty exhausted by now. Every part of me has layers of snow on it, my hair has icicles hanging from it and is frozen into one solid mass, my eyebrows and face coated and frozen with little bits of ice. I cannot walk anymore, merely shuffling along. I must look pretty destitute."

        "description": "After my aimless wandering, I decide to focus my efforts on getting home. I feel so worn, so tired… I put in headphones and listen to some music. Suddenly I am energized. My face turns into an indelible smile as I suddenly feel like I can do this. The music pulses through my being, warms my veins. I feel like I could run home through the snow, the abruptness and magnitude of this change is incredible. Everything is still breathing and covered in a nice smooth coating of pure, unfettered winter. After walking in circles around city hall trying to get my bearings I find a northbound street that will bring me home. I trudge up the unshoveled walk, the snow now up past my ankles. Its only falling harder now, leaving a thicker and more muffling blanket on every surface. Right before me, an avalanche slides off the roof of a church, a beautiful shimmering and sparking and glittering cascade, swirling to the ground and catching in the wind, the stray snowflakes being catapulted skyward and carried far away. I run into a man trying to get into the subway station. I ask if it’s running, he says it doesn’t seem like it. I continue on my way, trudging north. The man runs and catches up with me saying we could split the bill on a cab north, as he is headed there too. Interaction is hard and awkward, my own voice resounds in my skull and reverberates, consuming my entire soundspace. I agree, and we continue walking until we catch sight of a cab. We hail it and get in. The ride is bumpy and slippery and a lot of fun. The driver haphazardly weaves around snow drifts, paying no heed to lanes or anything. After all, they are completely obscured and there are no other cars on the road. I get off back at my university, and a friend invites me over to warm up and spend the night. Here, the winds are extreme. I can feel them blow me around, making it difficult to walk. They sculpt the snow into all sorts of patterns, the snow even forming dunes in one area. The dunes pulse with concentric circles.\n"

Things still breathe and pulsate color. I am so warm and so comfortable and so euphoric. Sleeping over with my friend and cuddling with her in her warm house as the storm rages outside in the dark smoky room is absolute bliss. We listen to music and talk late into the night as the trip withers away and gives way to a comfortable fatigue. Faint patterns dance on the ceiling, politely staring down at me throughout the rest of the night. I would say the afterglow effects continued for about 2 more hours before I can sleep. The next day I am extremely exhausted but practically glowing inside. "

This is fairly standard for me as far as psychedelics go however, pretty much all of them do this to me now. Other effects were not really noticeable until-\nThere is a sudden flash of energy. The trip instantly explodes to life without warning. One moment I was sitting there feeling uncomfortable, the next I am fully immersed in the experience. I have to pause my game and shut off the TV. I am shaking and shivering all over while glistening patterns peek in from the corners of my vision, violently polychrome with the piercing shine of a halogen light. The visuals are sharp and radial, like unfurling rainbow palmettos, spinning and expanding with vibrancy and vigor. The overall feeling is one of stimulation and energy, a colorful electricity crackling through my body. It feels like being caught in a sudden storm, where one moment the sky is clouded with the peaceful premonition and then without warning- impenetrable sheets of rain, gale force winds, searing lightning, and roaring thunder. My teeth are chattering, the physical effects feel particularly acute because I was not slowly immersed into them, rather I was dunked headfirst into their toothy maw. One interesting physical effect to note is random uncomfortable tactile sensations- little shocks and pinpricks and aches all over my body, popping up at random times and in random places. They do not seem to resolve no matter what position my body is in.\nEverything feels fluttery- the whipping rhythmic flashes of visuals, the tip taps on my skin, my racing heart, my nervous breath. It’s as though birds are sitting all over me, occasionally taking wing and flying off with pieces of my consciousness in their talons, carrying them to far-flung corners of the world. In addition to the radiating and pulsing and swirling patterns, there are some odd, drifting open eyed visuals, like aimless shadows wandering through my field of vision. With my eyes closed, I feel gentle and safe, the closed eye visuals are mild and hardly noticeable, which perhaps contributes to the feeling of a peaceable sanctuary. Everything seems so dreamy and unreal as the experience tugs at me and zaps me. Time dilation is very noticeable, it feels as if the last 5 minutes have been stretched out over half an hour. It is like a psychedelic vivisection, as I lie on my bed and the substance cuts me open and toys with my nerves."

It is like a bonfire rippling in a cold wind. I feel encased in my head, the closed eye visuals are mild and unremarkable and slightly synesthetic. To a degree I still feel somewhat cold and uncomfortable, but not as much as I did before. I feel good about myself for no real reason, which is a foreign but pleasant feeling. There is a great deal of euphoria and a warm sunny nostalgia. Ideas and thoughts are flowing freely through my head, my chains of thought feel productive and meaningful.

I am curious about how deep it can go, as I feel like there is some potential for it go further, but I’m doubtful as to how far that may be. It is a nice novel substance and an express trip, some of the cognitive effects hint as being useful for meditation and introspection and therapy, but they definitely need to be wrestled out of the stimulating nervous storm that it induces.

    "conclusion": "This is actually only my second time ever taking an empathogen, and my only time taking one alone. This is dangerous stuff. I make a fool of myself every time, I get too lovey dovey, start asking people personal questions and breaching their privacy and thresholds of socialization. It would maybe be good in a setting where everyone else was on the drug, but I felt like the level of empathy I was expressing was alienating and awkward. I am an awkward person, I have never truly felt like I’ve understood or felt social conventions or empathy, merely imitated them to avoid being ostracized. This seems reflected here, but it acts in a way of justifying my alienated awkwardness. Thus I express it to my fullest capability. I have to be careful with empathogens. I really do.\nAll in all however, this one is a worthy addition to the toolkit. Perhaps its most interesting feature is its total lack of stimulation. Some have gone so far as to describe is as sedating, but I would say its effects on my body were overall neutral. It is psychedelic too, at least mentally. I adopted the same sort of hyperanalytical and sensitive mindset that psychedelics give me, which mixed well with the completely uninhibited sociability. This could be a valuable tool if I learn how to rein in the uninhibited sociability. In terms of sensor effects, there was a sort of warm numbness reminiscent of dissociatives, with a sort of momentum/springiness/lightness. Sounds sounded deeper, like not deeper in pitch but having clearly discernible layers and dimensions. Visually, the only thing noticeable was a slight color enhancement, or colors appearing warmer as if a magenta overlay was subtly applied. Close eyed visuals were abstract and mostly composed of color fields interacting with one another.",

        "description": "I took the syrian rue by powdering it in a mortar and pestle and washing it down with milk, before waiting approximately 45 minutes to drink down 7 grams of MHRB blended into a banana smoothie. I only managed to drink roughly 6 grams, however, as the sheer amount of liquid was difficult to take in. Though these were both unpleasant and nauseating to consume, it was nothing when compared to the foul-tasting, traditionally-brewed method which I am extremely familiar with.\n\nI was tripping within the presence of 2 friends who were also taking ayahuasca through the same method of preparation; one of them took the full 7g and the other 2.5g of MHRB.\n\nAfter consuming the milkshakes, we spent approximately one hour in a well-lit living room, smoking marijuana and waiting for the effects of the drug to show before heading into a small, extremely dark room that we had previously prepared as an environment to enjoy the experience with maximum effects and minimal external influence.\n\nAt the start of the trip I simply sat there in darkness, listening to an album which I had not heard before that my friend was playing throughout the trip by a psytrance artist known as Tipper[1], whilst sharing marijuana-filled spliffs between my two friends as we engaged in typical stoner talk and psychedelic conversation. Shortly after I entered the darkened room I began to notice a distinct but mild body high and defined level 4 visual geometry. The fast-moving sets of complex geometry were structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, equal in blurred and sharp edges and equal in rounded and angular corners. They looked very natural, ancient and had mystical undertones in their perceived visual vibe.\n\nAs I began to progressively come up, I became more and more unresponsive in my ability to communicate and became reserved to total silence, despite the fact that I could still understand what my friends were discussing and listened intently throughout a huge portion of the trip."

        "description": "It was at this point that I began to break through into a visual space of profoundly complex level 6 geometry. I felt perfectly calm and extremely mindful as I saw all of those who are close to me laid out in front of my eyes. They appeared in the form of detailed visual representations, comprised of condensed psychedelic geometry. As this happened I began to evaluate them one by one as a voice within my head provided me with a detailed verbal analysis of how lucky I am to have such people in my life, while providing loving advice and information on their relationship to my existence and the need for me to care for them as much as they demonstrate that they care for me.\n\nAfter this I have large periods of amnesia as the visuals further increased in their intensity until at some unknown point in the evening I passed through the geometry and onto the other side. I then found myself in a state which I immediately recognised although had never previously experienced but knew that it was referred to by my own system as a level 4 State of unity and interconnectedness.\n\nAt first I simply noticed that the geometry had died down in its intensity from level 6 to level 4 and had been replaced by an overwhelmingly complex and seemingly life-changing perspective switch that could not be described as anything short of a substance-induced religious experience. I couldn't quite comprehend the true nature of what was happening but immediately felt profoundly calm and mindful in my thought processes towards it, understanding innately that I should not give in to astonishment as this is something that I often find myself becoming overwhelmed with in similar situations. I knew that if I did this I would slip into an all-too familiar state of ecstatic religious delusion and fool myself into thinking that I had not only figured out the key to humanity's transcension but that I now understand it well enough to immediately implement on a global scale \"just as soon as I sober up\".\n\nOnce this cleared up and I realized that I was not going to be overwhelmed with astonishment I began to slowly piece together what exactly it was that I was feeling. At first all I knew was that I had the overwhelming sense that this was somehow a \"religious experience\" although I had very little coherent sentences within my thoughts. As time went on however I slowly realized that my usually familiar and well-defined concept of \"I\", \"self\", or \"me\" was no longer attributed to a separate ego and it's internal thought stream as it is throughout normal sober living. Instead, it had become attributed to my internally stored model of reality in its entirety and therefore all of space and time.\n\n\"I\" suddenly saw with such clarity the interdependent connections between all things and realized that \"I\" was and always have been the entire universe experiencing itself through the specific point in space and time which my ego happens to reside in. It felt that \"I\" had simply forgotten this due to the inherent nature of the human form that this part of me had manifested itself into and the way in which my perspective has been drastically shaped by the surrounding society. The concept of a culturally ingrained and vaguely defined sense of self-hood that \"I\" had been raised into believing was revealed to be nothing more than an illusory symbol or approximation of words. \"I\" felt that in actuality \"I\" was not a central separate agent confronting an external world which was not \"me\", but that it was all the universe experiencing itself. \"I\" felt and understood that the observer and the observed were a unified system of behaviour, in which the concept of a separate self made no physical sense whatsoever beyond symbolic and illusory thought. In simpler terms, the true self beyond everyday illusion was revealed as something not confined to its ego and the image it has created of itself through interactions with other people, but the entire universe as a whole.\n\nThe sentences \"We are all it\" and \"I designed it this way myself\" looped through my thought stream over and over again. It was revealed to me through an innate revelation that the reason I am living this life, with this extremely specific geographic location, friends, loved ones, life and plot is not because of sheer chance or coincidence as I had previously thought but because I had designed it all this way myself. I had always existed throughout all times, I had created the universe which was myself and everything within it from the very beginning, nothing was left to simple chance and every aspect of this cosmic plot had been carefully planned out in advanced by the very thing which it was.\n\nIn a single moment I realized and felt with a huge sense of genuine emotion that every last one of my personal insecurities which comprised my particular silly tragic back story was a deliberate and important plot element which a great attractor was pulling the stuff of this reality into. It somehow became clear that although my ego associated these things with negative attachments, they were simply contrast to states of positivity and therefore, at a higher level, could only be viewed as harmonious order within a greater system which I felt to be truly perfect in every single way.\n\nAs this was happening I remained completely silent, occasionally sighing or quietly weeping tears of sheer joy into a blanket. Every now and then, however, I would regularly move to drink water and smoke more weed which my friends would periodically pass to me. When I moved to perform these actions they had a completely different feeling attributed to them in comparison to that of every day sober living in a way that was profound but extremely difficult to describe adequately.\n\nInstead of feeling that I was a central and separate ego rearranging the external environment around itself, I felt that the universe was simply a self-arranging autonomous process of continuously shifting energy transfers which comprised the greater whole with unified, interdependent sub-components that acted upon each other mutually. The bottle I was drinking from was just as much me as the person drinking it; it moved itself just as much as my body moved it, and my friends were simply manifestations of myself talking to itself.\n\nThis perspective was overwhelming and sustained itself for what must have been at least an hour or two. I laid there completely unresponsive to my friends but listening to the music and conversation whilst visualizing, and feeling everything which they were saying with incredible detail through high levels of conceptual thinking."

        "description": "Eventually, however, I began to come down and regained my ability and desire to communicate. We went for a walk in a local park and I felt truly overwhelmed by the experience which I had just encountered as it seemed to not only be life changing in its consequences but possessed as of yet unrecognised historical significance. At this point it became clear to me that assuming this perspective contained even a shred of understandable and scientifically verifiable truth, that it was the single most important discovery which humanity had ever or will ever make.\n\nAfter two years of studying the concept of unity and discussing it with those who have experienced it for themselves I was finally here. I had never seen it coming and had often accepted that perhaps my detailed knowledge of this concept and strong desire for the specific experience itself was the very thing that would forever hold me back from it. Perhaps it was this acceptance that allowed me to experience it, but I also strongly suspect that ayahuasca can consistently induce this state more so than any other psychedelic."

        "description": "I decided beforehand not to dwell on my previous 4acoDMT trip (the one where I thought I was dying), though I was aware of it when I took the stuff. First off, I remember seeing a black and white sphere of sharp, wiry visuals – the sphere was pulsating in time to the music. It was a little sinister, as the sharp visuals would periodically rush towards me and recede, then repeat the action and getting up in my face (though I had my eyes closed). I tried to smooth out the visuals, and add some color to them, but it would only work for a second and then revert to its original monochrome color and aggressive shape, despite how hard I tried to concentrate. Eventually I just let it all do what it wanted to, remember that it’s best to just go with it and accept the scenes as they are and not to try and control the trip – so I just watched. Eventually the pulsating calmed down, as I found my attention had shifted to the music (we were listening to Dub Side of the Moon, by Easy Star All Stars). We were listening to ‘Time’ and I heard the clock chimes in the intro, which I used to think of as discordant but I heard the clocks individually panning from ear to ear, and I imagined being in a room with the clocks, and saw that they had been carefully arranged and timed so that their sounds were pleasant and I appreciated just how much effort had been put into just recording these clocks.\n\nWhen the real instruments came in, the guitar and the occasional drums, I concentrated on the guitar and on just how pitch-perfect it was, and just how absolutely perfect and wonderful the whole album was! When the song kicked in properly, shit got real. The spikey sphere instantly exploded into millions of fragments and I saw the band playing their song in a yellow American school bus, driving over a rainbow in space (the bus was just like the one in the South Park intro). The scene changed and I saw the universe as a self-replicating Ouroboros, eating itself in self-perpetuation. I saw a man made of fragmented rainbow light vomiting up another rainbow man. You know, the usual.\n\nTime passed and I chatted with the others for a bit before heading back under the blanket. The music had changed, and we were listening to 1200 Micrograms, but I hadn’t realised that someone had put this on. I thought it was the soundtrack to the new universe. I imagined Hoffman taking LSD and being shot into outer space without his physical body, instantly transcending. I thought of the millions of people who have had a psychedelic experience like mine, and imagined that by taking whatever they took, they had reserved a place in the a new life after death, where we would all live on forever in the fabric of the universe and have a massive rave, and 1200 Micrograms would be the soundtrack! I heard voices amongst the music, saying “You are the universe experiencing itself” – this isn’t in the song but it’s something josikins has said to me before. I opened my eyes and the room was there, but my field of vision was being squashed down from above, and the word “Egodeath”, written in pink bubble writing, covered my vision. I closed my eyes and saw what I will try to describe as best I can now:\n\nI was travelling very fast along an endless plain, moving forwards. On the plain were symbols, words, and sometimes just pure meaning representing everything from the Big Bang onwards, to the creation of Earth, the dinosaurs, the beginnings of man, how we got to where we are now (though I can’t remember what it was), where we were going (sorry, don’t remember), and I carried on until the end of time (no, forgotten it). I kept thinking, rather knowing instinctively, that where I was had been visited by Hindu mystics and Buddhist monks for millennia; this was Nirvana, this sort of place took many years of mediation, training, and very hard work, and I had got here with a pill, sitting on the sofa, stroking a dog. I didn’t feel like I was cheating, because I think that the more people who can be ‘enlightened’, the better. And God knows the West needs it. Certainly, people will take these substances for a laugh, just to get fucked up, just for the novelty, but a significant number also get the message and treat them with the respect they deserve. I like to treat them like a sacrament."

I was, afterwards, convinced that when I eventually came down I was either going to transcend, or was at least going to have some incredible wisdom for the rest of my life. I was so convinced that it took a lot longer than normal for me to get completely sober. I was mildly disappointed that I was just me again."

Then a few minutes later I saw my friend’s face go ‘glitchy’, and his nose stretched and went back to normal. That all happened in a matter of seconds, and I knew I had started tripping. I closed my eyes and saw my first psychedelic visuals; geometric, brilliantly colored fractals and wire-y shapes morphing in front of me. I looked at my friend’s PC screen when he was changing the song, and saw inside the monitor; though the front was flat and I knew how thin the monitor was, I could see deep inside the screen, which looked like a very small room defined by a matrix of fantastic colors.\n\n\nI shut my eyes again and just followed the light show in front of me. Eventually I saw some sci-fi engine which, I guessed, was the particle accelerator of the universe’s engine. Or whatever. My friends and I took some Nitrous Oxide via balloons, and this set me off down a tunnel of rainbow colors (much like the DMT seal image found on disregardeverythingisay.com), accompanied by a high-pitched, generic sci-fi sounding noise (like a digital home telephone ringing constantly, but the pitch shift was linked to the speed I was going). I got very close to the end of the tunnel, but started to slow down and was exiting the tunnel, backwards. We took some more nitrous whilst standing up, and I noticed the tunnel’s shape had changed from just a circle to a symmetrical outline of a lady (like the ones you see on truckers’ mudflaps), again accompanied by the high pitched noise."

You’re typing that I’m tripping on salvia!”*\n\nFrom my perspective during this, the salvia hit me with instant ego death. I couldn’t remember who I was, or what anything was but I knew that something was hilarious and that I couldn’t stop laughing. However, I had forgotten the punchline to the joke and what it was that was funny in the first place. My body and vision stretched horizontally into infinity, and I felt as if I had become part of a colossal cube machinescape with many different complex components. I felt that this structure which I could both see and feel was my body. I was not aware that I had a body in the real world or that things had ever been any different. I was aware that Kaylee was another person in the room and that she was typing something, but I had no conception of what she was typing or what typing even was."

My next trip will be the coming Friday. I am going to take a heavy dosage of 2C-E (30mg) and it will likely yield far more interesting results.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "description": "I’d spent the last hour talking to a male friend on discord who I’ve recently been developing romantic feelings towards. I was feeling uncomfortable, and he was keeping me company and calming me down. I spontaneously started getting the sensation that my consciousness was “ageing backwards” and that I was regressing into a younger age. I felt more childlike and felt that my vocabulary was simplifying. The world around also me seemed new and unfamiliar. It made me feel incredibly uncomfortable in a way that was difficult to define.\n \nThis regression process continued to happen over a roughly half-hour period. I regressed into a preteen, a child, a toddler, a fetus, and finally into I regressed so far back that I felt as I had reached a stage before ever having even been born. When I arrived at this state which I interpreted as age “0”, I was overwhelmed with a sense of unity between my self and the entire totality of existence. I suddenly had the feeling that I had been regressed into a primordial and more basic state which precedes a humans existence. I felt that as a child grows and learns a language, they begin to separate the world around them into symbolic labels, concepts, and subconcepts. As this skill becomes increasingly ingrained into their cognitive functioning, the child can no longer step outside of it and are stuck within a system of thought that inherently separates the external environment into individual concepts which in actuality, are intrinsically unified and co-dependent upon one another. These sensations reminded me of “oceanic feeling” which is a very similar hypothesis that was posited by Freud.\n \nI had never experience personality regression before and felt very overwhelmed and frightened, I thought that the regression was somehow related to the recent death of my father as if the unexpected loss of a parental figure had triggered something inside of me during this trip and left me feeling like an incredibly vulnerable child.\n \nAfter this experience, I began to progress upwards back through the ages slowly. I felt like a rapidly ageing newborn baby that had been pushed into a frightening and unfamiliar world with no knowledge of survival or concepts.\n \nI felt that the universe was a system of exponential self-complexification which has the primary purpose of striving towards ever higher levels of order and interconnectedness. I felt that as a means to fulfil this goal, it seemed that the universe subtly arranged situations to occur with a predisposition of increasing the likelihood of furthering this process. As a by-product of this, I felt that concepts such as synchronicity, plot elements, and coincidences were hardcoded into the fabric of existence."

Although I may be wrong, I get the feeling that I will not experience unity again until I am in the next chapter of my life, probably sometime in my early 30’s.\n \nThis trip was by far the most uncomfortable and sinister state of unity which I have experienced so far. During the trip, I felt that it was threatening due to the way in which it was intrinsically tied into personality regression that felt as if it was triggered by recalling the recent death of my father.\n \nAs a result of this trip, I will be expanding upon the personality regression subjective effect article and researching the developmental psychology of identity and language within children.\n\nThanks for reading.",

The progressive numbing of my extremities seems to be creeping towards its apex while my sense of proprioception collapses and dissolves.

Cognitively, a slight touch of deeper emotion, empathogenesis, and euphoria trickles in.

The dissociation is heavily mental, with a feeling of detachment from language, semiotics, cultural constucts, and other societal essences of humanity. I feel mechanical and icy, like a chilly golem. This difficulty understanding words and sentences is coupled with a faltering short term memory, making conversation difficult. Physically, I am still functional, I can get up and walk and carry things with no issue. Thus, it is in no way a ‘hole’ experience yet. I am slightly nauseous and am rapidly alternating between feeling too warm or too cold. The visuals begin to appear as patterns, still composed of dots, like a pointillist painting. These dots are distributed in orderly and harmonious configurations, seemingly dictated by some underlying mathematical arrangement. Blocky shapes in this meticulous order also begin to appear."

It is very difficult to focus on one thing for long, leaving me in that default state of my mind drifting off into the abyss.

The orderly visuals adorn every surface, dancing and pulsing in calculated, mechanistic unison. It appears as though everything is lit from below by a purple light with no discernible source, everything appears futuristic, shiny, and weird. My thoughts are disorganized and arbitrary, and they often wither before they can fully develop, leaving me feeling a state of total flat neutrality, my cognitive processes reduced to impotent static. I feel like a cold city skyline at night, seen from a great distance. When I close my eyes I am hit with a ghost image of the room that appears to be composed of a collage of numbers, letters, and other odd symbols. If I lie down with my eyes closed long enough, this dissolves into a great black and purple swath of something or nothing. Eventually this scene becomes occupied by characters, odd blocky humanoid figures composed of dense sections of random numbers, moving jerkily and going about their seemingly normal everyday activities, such as sitting at a laptop, or walking around their plane aimlessly. These beings do not really present in any discernible way- not good, or evil, benevolent, kind, caring, not even indifferent, they simply exist, like I am watching them through a screen, witness to them but entirely separated. I do not care about them, and they do not care about me, and it is alright. I return downstairs to find myself further physically impaired, with my sense of momentum and proprioception heavily compromised. Talking has now become difficult due to being unable to feel my mouth, and thus being unaware of how to properly use it to form phonetic sounds. I am pulsing like a jellyfish and my field of vision is being sliced into blocks that begin to separate from each other and form into 3-d cubes."

I found myself with my head lazily thrown back, slack jaw hanging open staring aimlessly at the ceiling. These patterns were not even moving or breathing or shifting, they were simply there, static and bold. Moving my eyes around left tessellated rainbow afterimages of everything, their forms fringed by this same squiggly suture pattern. It feels like everything is covered in spiderwebs and when I move I am disturbing some tentative stringy connection with everything else in the room. That I am anchored in some way to every surface and I feel a slight elastic resistance to every movement, as if the drug is gently but sternly suggesting that I remain still, static, slack and frozen."

I have curled up on the couch next to my friends and closed my eyes and become entirely separated from the reality they inhabit.\nThe hole began with a great golden pulsating concentric angular patterns across my eyelids. This soon became wiped aside by a great black abyss, which was soon speckled with explosions and splatters of little white dots, like CRT static or a blizzard. The abyss began to fold up into a network of cylindrical shapes and tubes, still streaked and battered with this onslaught of white particles. These forms then became cut and partitioned, it felt like my mind was being split into sections and separated into its various components. At last this visage shattered to reveal a vast infinite forest of spindly conifer trees, arranged in an eternal field of fractal patterns. I found myself hovering above it, then wandering amongst the trees, the sky above deep and infinitely black, no stars or clouds or anything. The white particles became a raging blizzard, the snow swirling and blowing around me and grating away at my vision. The ground was white with a shallow accumulation of snow. The forest was not scary, or uncomfortable, like everything else this trip it was fundamentally neutral. There was no fear in my heart, no sense of being lost or out of place, simply a sense of being somewhere new. It almost felt magical, and the mystery and majesty of the vastness bathed me in the glory of exploration. Upon opening my eyes and returning to the hole, I found myself immediately back among the forest, not having to navigate the convoluted entry process again. As time progressed I found myself entering a different sort of hole, a more abstract space where I was able to generate clear imagery in my mind, though without constant focus these would soon decay into rainbow concentric ripples and lose their form."

It’s essence was elusive and mysterious, it felt as though it was a drug that existed at the fringes of consciousness that simply was not meant to be understood. The cold and wintry essence of infinity that it contained was perhaps a symptom of the cold winter day, but the depths of the experience were certainly isolating and chilly. The afterglow is very very long and left me feeling off-balance for days. ",

At this point I feel extremely happy and optimistic and have an elated sense of self worth, believing myself to be some sage or philosopher or some shit. I begin lecturing people on the internet about the power of positive thinking and happiness and I honestly can do nothing but smile. Things are still flashing and making ghost images and such. I've taken to just making inane observations and shouting them at people like they are grand epiphanies."

My perspective seems to be zooming and warping. I rush home to safety as things continue to rise. I get home and get back on my computer. The cool colored patterns crawl across every surface.

I lie on my bed and meditate. The closed eye visuals are extremely intense. I do not feel my ego fading or the usual sort of mindfuck that comes with closed eye meditation. Instead I simply sit back and enjoy the show of stepped and diamond patterns that replicate and dance and glow. It’s purely eye candy. Soon however, even this gives way and I can feel myself meditating into a more dissociated state. Not really pure mindfuck or strangeness, but the feeling of my body vibrating away and my mind abandoning it. Using the computer, I do not get that persistent curiosity and feeling of being easily distracted and stimulated by everything, something very evident with most other drugs (Weed, 2C-E, LSD, 25c-NBOMe, 4-HO-MiPT to name a few). The visuals begin to pulse and radiate, they are very liney like 2C-B. Tracers very present too. I am shaking quite a bit, though also feel very relaxed and sedated, like I just don’t feel like moving at all. Auditory distortions present themselves, it sounds like music is slowing down and dropping in pitch. It feels like each layer of sound is being separated and isolated, warped and chewed up as it travels to my brain.\nMy thoughts begin to become similar to those of LSD- I begin to view things very objectively, it’s like my thoughts have been cleaved from my emotions and subconscious and simply exist in the present, ruthlessly and relentlessly analytical. To that degree, I begin listening to music with vocals. Song lyrics become such a strange thing in my mind, turning one’s thoughts into words, applying those words to melodies and rhythm, it’s an instrument made of language, it’s an instrument where the art is conveyed not only through aesthetic soundforms but also linguistics. Weird. I feel like a little grub curled up in the roots of the world. This is a blast. Visuals are very very strong and fun."

I am wary that this might cause too much mindfuck to be around people, but that ends up not being the case. Instead, only the visuals and euphoria kick up. This is so cool this is so fun I love this drug. I feel so jovial, I am having a great time just being around people, talking to people, cracking jokes etc. I try to play zoo tycoon on my computer but it doesn’t work. The next hour is encompassed by a struggle to do this, it feels like a futile task and never works out, but I never got frustrated or upset, this substance kept me on a very happy and pleasant baseline."

It is as if a cold and sterile scalpel has made a cut so thin and clean that it has rended reality apart and left me partitioned in my own private space.\nThe open eyed visuals now manifest as flashing faint diamond patterns, especially visible against lights, like that of my laptop.  It looks like two bulges are pulsing on either side of my field of vision, the same sort of peripheral shadows one may see when they rub the corner of their eye. The close eyed visuals are almost like video clips, vivid and clear, built from my memories of the day- of the may day protests I witnessed in the city that morning, the masses of people and signs and banners and the faceless black bloc and the energy of people in resistance. I feel like my face is drooping and melting in a most surreal and ethereal manner, like tentacles are hanging down from it, this is not so much of a physical sensation as it is some odd discrepancy in my normal perception."

It has stealthily and carefully assassinated me and replaced my former self with a new self, constructed from half formed memories and odd semblances of human thought. I feel emotionally flat and unempathetic to a disturbing degree. I feel as though I am missing some human essence, that I have been replaced with an artificial humanity that falls directly in the depths of the uncanny valley. I still cannot entirely articulate how I was different, I just was. I must be wary with who I interact with while on this substance, as I may behave in uncharacteristic ways.

I find myself constantly getting distracted and falling into super deep focus on each distraction, only to get distracted again. The headspace at this point is potently psychedelic and is reminiscent of other \"psychedelic\" dissociatives, though there are no accompanying visuals or sensory effects. I read through news stories and vividly imagine the events surrounding each one, creating detailed and emotionally compelling narratives in my head, empathizing with each character in each story. Perhaps this sudden hallucinated empathy is me coming back into myself, to compensate for the total flatness I was feeling before.\n"

    "conclusion": "This dissociative holds value for its novelty, though I did not find it particularly useful. The near total lack of physical effects was interesting, as was the all consuming cognitive dissociation. It was not physically stimulating, but was quite mentally stimulating. The sense of disconnection from the world and from myself was stark and would have been startling had I not sunken into it so gradually. The sensory effects were mild and nondescript. Overall this is an odd drug, though I really do not see any way I could utilize it in the future, whether it be for introspection or for social settings. I would hardly call this a dissociative in fact, it is it's own unique and totally novel sort of alteration, though not one that I am eager to revisit. I would most compare the headspace to O-PCE, dull, neutral, and emotionless, though as I mentioned, without physical effects.",

I am eventually 100% anesthetized, it feels like my body has folded up on itself until its become nothing. The analogy I can make is a pretty specific reference to a manga… If you’ve read/watched Jojo’s bizarre adventure part 3: stardust crusaders, there is that character towards the end named Vanilla Ice who is capable of folding up to disappear from our dimension. He does this by having the demonic creature that accompanies him eat him. It then eats itself until it is nothing but a jaw, which then also blips out of existence. That’s how I felt. That is exactly how I felt. (see the end of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlXsxc2G7iQ) (Sorry for the weird reference but I was in the midst of reading the series at the time). It was now that I was cast into the dream world. I was literally revisiting my old and recent dreams, watching them like movies. I could feel the same feelings I felt during them, and they were attached by free association. It was like exploring the structure of my subconscious through virtual reality. I would experience one dream, and then seeing an object, location, or having a feeling from that dream would immediately bring up a chain of associations that would lead to another past dream. This chain continued indefinitely. It was fascinating to explore, and it was so so strange to feel something so familiar that I had forgotten about. I was truly traversing my unconscious. I have no idea when I had these dreams, most did feel fairly recent, but these were certainly not random inventions, upon being exposed to them it triggered the distinct memories I had about them. After a bit I managed to pull myself out of it, just to see if I could."

It seems like this is a sort of “dream nexus”, similar to that I felt on DXM. I slither between the hills, and each grid mark is the entrance to another dream. I do not see the associations between them anymore, and unlike DXM these are not just hallucinated versions of my reality, but actual dreams I have had. I am like the librarian of this vast dream library, completely alone in its infinite scape to peruse these memories as I like. I can literally tap into whichever one I want. Well, I’m not sure what each one is until I enter it, but once I’m in, the chain of associations continues. Very fascinating."

My chest feels tight and light simultaneously. My heart is fluttering. I see faces and figures in the corners of my vision. It’s scary to look into reflective surfaces, as strange dark figures appear in them. Mysterious, indistinct, and indescribable auditory hallucinations come in from every direction. I have to urinate frequently. This swirling fog that has become my visuals has turned thick and all encompassing. Everything I see appears distant and like a vast landscape, the whole world is an immeasurable vista expanding out before me. Every aspect of the world around me is twisting like clockwork, intertwining and interlocking, meshing into ambiguous forms. This begins to appear as open eyed visuals-detailed and deep textures overlaid on everything, not really any clear patterns but 3-dimensional visuals. It is as if I am viewing another dimension that has become physically manifest before me in some way I can sense and comprehend. My entire field of vision is flashing various colors (red, blue, teal, green). Everything is blurry. The experience is very hard to describe and focus on, it is like it is purposely trying to elude comprehension. I am suddenly stricken by an intense inability to focus. I try to think about the experience and take notes, but I keep getting pulled away, I keep getting distracted and drawn off without even noticing that I have been led astray. It feels like I am swimming against the current, or trying to dive down with a floatation device attached. This isn’t the intense scatterbrained focus that comes with being stoned or other psychedelics. This is just raw and shallow distraction, I can’t engage with anything or learn anything or effectively do anything. Sometimes, with certain substances, I can harness my distractability to really sink into various tasks and take in a wide range of information. This just feels flat and pallid.\n"

In my experience, no group of drugs has been able to defy descriptions more than these weird tryptamines, to the point where they are divorced from the rest of the tryptamine family and could be considered a class of drugs of their own. This one in particular filled me with a crushing inability to focus. What a weird drug. I’m not sure if the experience was enjoyable and there was a bit of bodyload. Probably won’t repeat the experience, there isn’t much value to me except as a novelty. ",

        "description": "I took the syrian rue by powdering it in a mortar and pestle and washing it down with milk, before waiting approximately 45 minutes to drink down 7 grams of MHRB blended into a banana smoothie. I only managed to drink roughly 6 grams, however, as the sheer amount of liquid was difficult to take in. Though these were both unpleasant and nauseating to consume, it was nothing when compared to the foul-tasting, traditionally-brewed method which I am extremely familiar with.\n\nI was tripping within the presence of DemFractalsYo who was also taking ayahuasca, but through the Ayahuasca cupcake method of preparation; she took 2g of syrian rue and roughly 2.5g of MHRB.\n\nAfter consuming our substances, we spent approximately one hour in a well-lit living room whilst waiting for the effects of the drug to show. The first set of effects I noticed were a distinct body high which felt like a warm soft bodily glow and a brightening of colours. This was accompanied by strong level 3 drifting within and across flat surfaces around the room such as the carpet, ceiling and walls.\n\nIn terms of cognitive alterations, it was at this point that I started to feel anxious and paranoid over the thought that perhaps I should not have taken ayahuasca tonight as I felt the overwhelmingly negative vibe that \"something was not right\". I could not identify its source and simply decided that I should give my ayahuasca usage a break after this trip to collect my thoughts, as I realized that I had literally been taking it on a daily basis for what must have been weeks. This feeling of anxiety remained, however - even after I had reached this conclusion but I did not let it overwhelm me and it faded once I began to concentrate on other things."

        "description": "We decided that we were now tripping hard enough to leave the well lit living room and enter into a small, extremely dark room that we had previously prepared as an environment to enjoy the experience with maximum effects and minimal external influence. We entered the room and I began to feel that my subconscious was \"fucking with me\" or \"trolling me\" as if it was trying to teach me some sort of lesson, and it was resulting in strong feelings of anxiety. I expressed this to DemFractalsYo and after an extremely short period of discussion we were interrupted by a shelf collapsing behind us, creating a sudden loud noise and tipping miscellaneous objects all over us. This terrified me and created the strongest sensation that the universe was deliberately trolling me as some sort of test to evoke a response.\n\nAt this point I was beginning to trip hard and was experiencing extremely defined level 4 visual geometry within the darkness of the room. These fast-moving sets of complex geometry could be described as completely typical and standard to that of the ayahuasca experience. They were structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, equal in blurred and sharp edges and equal in rounded and angular corners. They looked very natural, ancient and had mystical undertones in their perceived visual vibe. We felt that we must be close to hitting our peaks and began to smoke marijuana to intensify the experience. After a vague period of time, my roommate knocked on the door and informed me that a close friend was in the living room and that it was his birthday. We were tripping hard but decided to leave the safety of our small dark room and wish him happy birthday.\n\nUpon entering the living the room and wishing our friend happy birthday I noticed that the visual geometry became extremely frantic in its motions. The intricate patterns condensed into wires made of light which proceeded to rapidly flail about my visual field in random unpredictable directions. I sat down and realized that they were watching a military film which appeared to be set in a modern day Iraqi or Afghan war zone. Almost immediately I began to feel extremely anxious as the soldiers began shooting each other whilst the trip continued to intensify in its effects. This lead me to become extremely immersed within the violence and suffering. I was beginning to teeter on the brink of ego death and feared that I would lose control and attack my friends in the battle field despite the fact that I did not have a gun.\n\nMoments later I progressed ever deeper into the ego death and lost my sense of self momentarily. I then started to feel that I was the universe searching for itself within itself but had entirely forgotten that it was itself. At this point a brief moment of realization hit me, I realized that I had found myself and that it had been right in front of me all along. The real me was revealed as not something which resides inside the skin but everything around me with which I connect. There was not a single coherent linguistic thought within my internal narrative but through feeling alone I knew what was happening. I had once again began to enter a state of unity and interconnectedness but as I realized this my attention was drawn back to the terrifying sounds of guns and death. I decided that perhaps this was not the most appropriate environment to be tripping on a psychedelic, I grabbed the spliff which I had given to my room-mate, and hurried back to the safety of our private trip room with my friend and my dog who had decided to follow us.\n\nUpon entering the room I sat down and commented on how genuinely frightened the film had made me before instantly beginning to slip straight back into ego death once more. It was at this point which I became completely silent and unresponsive.\n\n\"Are you ok?\" \"Are you sure?\" \"What's happening?\" \"Can you talk?\" \"Is everything alright?\"\n\nI heard these phrases and understood them but could only nod or shake my head in response. I was completely unsure of what was happening and found myself stuck in a thought loop in which I repeatedly performed reality checks to ensure that I was not dreaming. I started to feel that everything around me had been taken to it's most extreme of options. I looked at my dog and assumed that it was going to attack me, I turned the light off and assumed that something evil was now lurking within the darkness, I heard my friends within the living room and assumed they were going to drag me out and force me to become responsive. I then looked at the darkened silhouette of my friend and assumed that she was forcefully trying to have sex with me. I was too immobile to respond to any of these threats but saw my friend lit up, floating around the room comprised entirely of condensed visual geometry while she audibly stated \"it's ok josikins, nobody would know!\". This continued until my girlfriend unexpectedly entered the room after arriving home from work and the moment I saw her I assumed that she too was about to forcefully have sex with me.\n\nI continued to lay there in the darkness, I was extremely disorientated but after a vague period of time I slipped out of these continuous delusions and although I could not talk, a sense of clarity began to wash over me. I realized that my sense of self, I or me had become attributed to all of existence. I felt once again that I was not just a separate skin-encapsulated being trapped within a physical body but, an organism which was one with this entire universe. I felt this so strongly and saw that the room around me was as much a part of myself as any other. I felt that this room and this body was deeply interconnected and dependent upon the entire universe which resided within and around it and that every last atom of it was all me.\n\nI looked at my watch and felt that I had somehow stepped out of the illusion of relative time and that I could access all times from the creation of the universe to its destruction and dissipation. It was revealed to me that everything which had ever happened or will ever happen across the entirety of this reality's timeline were all \"me\" and that I had existed for an eternity. The ayahuasca showed me that human beings were trapped in an illusion of perspective which made it seem as if only the present physically existed. In actuality however, it was stated that all events past, present and future exist together and are continuously occurring within their individual time frames simultaneously.\n\nThis realization that I was not only all of physical existence within the present moment but all of existence across all time frames resulted in some immediate and profound subconscious extrapolations of perspective. I suddenly felt that I had existed since the beginning of time, long before this particular part of me had come into play a mere 20 years ago. I felt that I was the supreme thinker behind all actions which had ever occurred but that I had forgotten this due to the nature of this part of my self's particular human form.\n\nIt became somehow clear to me that I had created this entire universe perfectly and consciously down to the tiniest detail. My entire life was felt to have been planned out in advance by this supreme self which was me and so had everybody else's. I understood that my true self outside of this insignificant body contained all of existence. I was therefore all knowing, all powerful, resided everywhere and had created everything. The moment I felt this it all clicked together. I was and always had been the very definition of god itself in every sense of the word. We were all god and the basis for such a concept in a scientific, logical universe finally became clear to me. I felt that I had stumbled upon the answer to our existence and became overwhelmed with profound religious ecstasy.\n\nThis feeling was paralyzing and stayed with me for an extended period of time. I sat there in disbelief trying to comprehend the full gravity of this new ayahuasca induced perspective. The music played and I ignored it up until the moment that an extremely relevant song began to play. We were listening to a band known as Shpongle[1], it was a long, drawn out instrumental introduction but I knew what was coming. The beat kicked in and the female vocalist began to sing the chorus,\n\n\"You are me and I am you. I'll always be with you.\" \"You are me and I am you. I'll always be with you.\" \"You are the sun, the rain, and the moon beams. You are the Divine Goddess of my dreams.\" \"You are the sun, the rainbows, the moon beams. You are the Divine Goddess inside me\"\n\nIt was too much. I understood these lyrics on a level which I had never previously felt and instantly began to break down into tears of sheer profundity. I cried continuously as I weeped for everything that had ever or would ever exist. I understood just how perfect this world really was and continued to breakdown as I came to terms with my new reality and the true nature of existence. Throughout this my friend watched over me and reassured me that everything was ok. On occasion I would stop crying for just a moment, temporarily regain the ability to speak in a perfectly sober manner and ask the question \"could you please roll another spliff?\" before immediately regressing back into the emotional breakdown. This was a religious experience in every sense of the word and I felt clearly that it was the most profound moment of my entire life. Despite all of this however, I still held a strong desire to keep smoking marijuana spliffs throughout it."

I thanked her for watching over me and understood clearly what an extremely important person she would always be in my life. The feelings of unity subsided and I was no longer everything but completely psychologically exhausted. I hugged my friend goodbye and collapsed in bed as I had work the next morning and needed to be up for 7am. In the morning I woke up feeling absolutely refreshed and ready to face the day despite the fact that I had only slept for roughly 3 - 4 hours.\n\nOver the following weeks I noticed that this trip had inflicted lasting changes to my perspective of the world. I could no longer look at my life and the things within it without getting the strongest physical sensation that \"I designed it this way myself\". Even weeks after the experience had ended, I was walking my dog through a local park and came across a tree. I began to breakdown and became overwhelmed once again with the feeling that my true self had designed it this way and marveled at the profound complexity of its composition. This new perspective lasted for roughly 3 weeks but eventually faded into an idea which was only intellectually understood but no longer physically or emotionally felt.\n\nAll in all this experience was the most profound that I have ever been through. I cannot over exaggerate just how life changing it really was and simply recollecting it in such a high level of detail for the purposes of documentation resulted in the shedding of tears at multiple points throughout the writing process."

I’m pretty sure that they smelled more intensely than normal, more clearly defined. I could smell individual flowers from a bunch all at the same time. I found a quiet spot in the sun when I was in the park proper, and meditated. I thought about myself from the view of an outsider, and analysed some of the things I had said to some friends in the last week, and I was remedying myself; I ought to be a more considerate friend, I ought to make more time for the people I don’t see very often, things like that. The visuals weren’t all-encompassing, but they were a nice touch to what was a more psychologically cleansing trip. There were no cosmic mysteries, no aliens, no ancient religion, it was all down-to-earth and concerned with normal activities and how to improve myself. It kept my ego in check, as opposed to stripping it away, and the good vibes carried on for a few more weeks after; I made the time to see my seldom-seen friends, and was more reassuring to one or two who were having family troubles at the time."

I had no conception of who or what I was, but I felt incredibly calm and serene. \n\nMy brain has seemingly been rendering the maximum amount of endless, incomprehensible hallucinations that it possibly can at the expense of all other cognitive processes. I completely separated from my body and saw thousands upon thousands of extraordinarily vivid and detailed scenes of places, entities, and genuinely incomprehensible forms. I both saw these scenes in front of me and became them. I could feel every single detail of these vivid hallucinations as if they were my own body. They were more complex and detailed than anything that could possibly exist in the \"real\" world. A significant percentage of their forms defied all logic and appeared to be impossibly shaped. \n\nThe sheer intensity and amount of the breathtaking, incredible scenes eventually began to leave me completely overwhelmed with sensory overload.

    "conclusion": "This trip was an absolutely mindblowing experience and easily the hardest I have tripped in over two years. It seems that somewhere in the mind, there is a button that triggers the brain into activating a \"complete simulate render 3D hallucinate everything mode\". 2C-E somehow presses this button perfectly.\n\nI am completely baffled that the brain is even capable of rendering thousands upon thousands of scenes which are so detailed, intricate, and vivid that they are incomprehensible beyond anything which could ever occur within the real world. What possible evolutionary advantage could the presence of this mode of action have? Especially considering that it is usually only activated during the most obscure of situations, such as ingesting a synthetic phenethylamine psychedelic. These compounds could do a fraction of what they are capable of, and they would still be one of the most profound experiences available to a human being. \n\nThis trip truly pushed myself to the limits of what I could withstand and reignited my respect for these compounds. Although I could likely tolerate a heavier dosage of 2C-E, there would be no point as it would probably just involve me passing out into unconsciousness.\n\nFor my next hallucinogenic experiences, I will be ingesting Salvia divinorum at a wide range of dosages and documenting the results.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "description": "I was getting a weird half breakthrough. After what feels like 30 seconds after I smoke, I initially thought I wasn't going to get strong effects; then it seemed like there was an entity with a female voice right behind me who was trying to pull me backwards and to the left through the cracks in the couch into another room. Despite not egodeathing I didn't question the entities presence or it trying to pull me into the salviaverse. I got the impression that she was going to take me on a tour, but the dosage wasn't enough. \"you took too low of a dose, you cant fit.\" she said. \"I was going to show you around.\" there was also another salvia person standing right behind me who was silent.\n\nI saw part of the place they were taking me to; it half looked like a courtyard with some building entrances on the other side of it. The courtyard was small, no more than 20-30ft. One the left side of it, there was a building with a roof that sloped downwards to the ground with red lights on the edge of it. What I saw was half salvia/people courtyard and half a bookshelf that I was looking at in the physical world. I could feel the entity trying to suck me into the salviaverse. I had the delusion/thought that I should say something to my girlfriend regarding what I'm seeing, but the female voice said \"don't say anything yet\", and I was delusional enough to just go along with it. I came down around a minute later and started recounting the trip to my girlfriend."

However, this may well be my favourite dissociative. It's spiritual and therapeutic effects easily rival that of any of the classical tryptamines for me. \n\nI suspect this may well be due to the way in which DXM presents psychedelic effects combined with dissociative effects. It seems to be 70% dissociative and 30% psychedelic. Either way, I am very much looking forward to trying this substance at a wide range of dosages to fully document the experience.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "description": "I loaded up 15mg of \"15x\" extract into a bong. I then lit it up with a with a mini torch lighter while listening to Queen of all everything by OTT. \n\nLess than 30 seconds later, the trip immediately hit me like a tonne of bricks. My vision separated into multiple sections in a manner which was based on my actual environment. I realize that I can't remember who I am but I can see glimpses of the real world between the sections. I became a cog/tooth of a vast slowly rotating gear that was hundreds of meters tall. There were four gears of equal size alongside of each other. High above this giant gear was a ceiling that was actually my carpet. I was descending down into darkness as the cog rotated. As I descended into the earth, I tried to hold on to the memory that I am Josie and that I just smoked salvia. I quickly realize I can't even remember that but still vaguely understood that I should attempt to just wait this out and not worry or try to act on my confusion because I'll end up saying something stupid.\n\nSeconds later, I immediately forgot that social norms are a concept which exists and started repeatedly saying things like “holy shit” “this is insane” \"this is crazy\" \"I remember this\" “whoa” \"document this.\" \n\nAs I continued being a tooth of a cog in a larger machinescape, I start realizing that this salvia was definitely stronger than 15x and might even be 50x. I started laughing manically about that. I found it hilarious that I had accidentally overdosed but was also concerned that whatever I was in the real world (which I had no memory or concept of) was going to lose control and do something terrible. After what felt like a minute or two I quickly realized who I was, that I'm in a room with my girlfriend, and what that even meant. My girlfriend informed me that I had been out for around ten minutes. The entire experience felt like 2 minutes at the most."

    "conclusion": "\nThis was my first salvia trip in over a year. I was expecting this to be a threshold dosage with very mild physical effects. Although during the trip, I was under the impression that this is much stronger than a 15x extract. After seeing how my girlfriend responded so mildly to this batch of salvia, I now believe that it is indeed a 15x extract and that the reverse tolerance which salvia produces is still present within my brain, even though it has been around seven years since I last used salvia on a regular basis. \n\nI now recall that as a teenager around the age of 17-18, I used to smoke salvia and break through every single day for months at a time. Over this period, I began needing less and less salvia to trip and could eventually ego death on even small amounts of unprocessed leaf powder. Before the trip, this had completely slipped my mind, and I did not expect the reverse tolerance to last this long.\n\nThis salvia trip was easily one of the most intense and bizarre experiences I have ever been through, at least since my last salvia trip over a year ago. There is something bizarre and unique about this drug. I now intend to experiment with this 1gram bag on a semi-daily basis while documenting every single experience it induces.\n\nThanks for reading.",

    "introduction": "I could never have imagined a more perfect setting would present itself. My friend was back at his parent’s house in the suburbs, a place familiar to me since I was 6 years old, a place of comfort and pleasant memories. They had a large property with a beautiful pool and garden, and it was in a textbook idyllic suburb on an incredible sunny summer day. The sheer inherent contentment and pleasantry and nostalgia of the place was overwhelming even without the help of drugs. Not only would I be in this place of deep emotional resonance, but 4 of my closest and dearest friends would be there with me, all of us achieving alteration in various ways. Our host took LSD, one simply would be smoking a lot of weed, and the other two were taking 2C-B, one of them having this be their first ever psychedelic experience. I was very excited.\nI was a bit stoned for the train ride/the walk there and was also on the afterglow of 3-MeO-PCP I had taken the previous night. The walk was filled with manicured trees and flowers and the idle sounds of distant lawnmowers and dogs barking and birdsongs, the soundtrack of the living breathing suburb. I’ve always been a fan of filth and chaos and laziness and mess, and at times the ostentatious cleanliness and order of suburbs has come off as insincere and unnatural to me. Just a pretentious way to feel superior to people who felt superior. Right now though it was pleasure and peace to bask in, just overwhelming surface beauty. Enough about how I feel about suburbs though, it's mostly besides the point and sounds pretentious. Bottom line is everything seems great and I’m hanging out with some of my best friends.",

I find my body under immaculate control that I could not have imagined before. In catching insects, I find my fine motor skills are very much superior, being able to easily pluck insects off of flowers with my forceps before they are able to fly away. This is despite my visual field being interrupted by the strong visuals that cause plants and variegated textures to mirror themselves and flash with green and magenta auras. In swimming, I feel graceful like a fish or dolphin. This one may have just been perception, I probably looked clumsy as hell but I sure felt graceful and elegant. I am so perfectly lucid too. This drug feels not like an experiment or alteration, but an enhancement, it’s travelling down a well-travelled path, it’s a well-practiced routine that I am bathing in the benefits of. It’s pure unbridled joy and revelry and beauty, all chemically enhanced to my very liking and specification. I flip around underwater and close my eyes, feeling weightless in suspended in a wonderful fractal bliss. There are very few closed eye visuals- they mostly present with my eyes open. Wearing goggles, or opening my eyes underwater, I am greeted with the familiar visual patterning of 2C-B, lines, striations, stripes, floral and foliate designs in calming pulsing colors.\n"

Bumblebees will rarely consciously sting, rather I mishandled it and pricked my finger on its stinger, probably against its intent. Normally this would be a cause for alarm, but in my state I don’t mind at all, even when my hand swells up substantially. I continue swimming like nothing happened, although there is some itchiness and achiness to it the rest of the night. We are all joking and laughing and giggling so much at this point that it hurts. Who knows if any of this was truly funny or if we simply found giggliness and humor in our altered states? But it was extremely fun regardless and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and having a great trip. The nice suburban neighbors periodically stop in and out of their house doing errands and yardwork etc. We make a concerted effort to assure the odor of burning kush doesn’t creep too close to them. It’s weird to think about them going about their daily lives while next door we’re plunging into the depths of our perception. I don’t mean that in some pretentious superiority complex “suburban sheeple not doing psychedelics” way, it was honestly truly strange to think about, an alien thought to mill about in my mind like a wad of clay."

I am entirely entranced and consumed by thought that splashes me like treading water at the surface of a choppy sea. The grass of the backyard spreads out before me like an undulating ocean. We turn our attention to the spectacular golden hour hearkened by the sun as it creeps down the sky. The trees are bathed in golden light like gilded snowcaps, a large cluster of spiderwebs in the treetops catching the light at just the right angle and glistening like a tangle of golden chains. The branches and leaves of the trees are mirroring and fractalizing themselves like snowflakes or blossoming fern fronds. I draw and find myself drawing the usual psychedelic fare, this time the theme is sea creatures. I don’t seem to have the sense of aesthetics and composition granted by LSD. The drawing ends up sloppy and ill composed and I never finish it."

In the state that I’m in, they look extremely 3-dimensional, and not nearly as ethereal as a cloud should. It is like twisted ivory and driftwood sits looming above us, the deep blue dusk sky as a backdrop, its vastness and distance so impossible to comprehend that my mind simply perceives it as a near and flat screen. I play the album ‘Since I Left You’ by the Avalanches, which creates such a wonderful beautiful atmosphere (for me at least. Maybe it was selfish for me to put on an entire album that only I knew about…) The heavily layered songs get picked apart in my sinking and pulsing thoughts like a grand jovial jigsaw puzzle. We smoke some weed and order a pizza. The process of ordering it is an absurdly complex ordeal in our state but we manage eventually. I find my appetite is not as compromised as it usually is on psychedelics. After this we return to the water."

Like I mention in the report, it’s not necessarily deep or empathogenic or anything, its overall quality is that it’s just plain fun. It makes everything funnier, it makes jokes and quips flow out better and develop more articulately. One other thing that stands out was how warm it was, just a sensation of warmth within and without, a dry pulsing rippling heat that is still very pleasant. It’s a warmth that radiates outwards from the core and from the skull, leaving one’s sternum feeling like it’s made of heated metal. It’s also decently long lasting, without too much bodyload. It’s not very visual, and the visuals are just distortions and abstractions, no real patterns or anything to note. Unfortunately, a vendor selling this for a massive discount discontinued selling it literally the day after this trip when I was planning on ordering much more. Whelp.",

It had roughly the same degree of pain as 2C-B, but it was markedly more unpleasant due to the greater quantity of powder being consumed. The pain also lingered a great deal longer than it did with other 2C-x compounds. The nature of the experience itself resembled other explorations with 2C-C- it was marked with a certain latent energy, like heat rising off of hot asphalt. It rippled with fire and electricity like a transformer explosion, and was adorned with bright pulsing and flashing visuals, architectural and structural and artificial, with a focus on radial and concentric forms conforming to straight, careful frameworks. The headspace was euphoric, with a manic stimulant rush, probably owing to the intensity of the route of administration.",

I am getting the typical phenethylamine high frequency twanging effect, to reiterate, imagine having a taut wire and then plucking it. Instead of slowing down as it vibrates it reverberates faster and faster, increasing in pitch and frequency. This is what was happening with my existence, little pockets of the fiber of reality twanging off at the corners of my being, visuals that feel like the room is closing in on me while simultaneously expanding and vibrating into a rippling infinity. The patterns are all definitely very warm colored.\nI don’t know why this keeps happening but thoughts of violence and damage to my body begin to seep into the trip. I begin imagining what it must be like to receive a gunshot wound, whether it’s a bullet embedding in my flesh, or perhaps exiting out of the back of me with a spurt of dislodged flesh and blood, or perhaps it grazing me and picking off a chunk of flesh like a pickaxe chunking off a bit of rock. The thought of heavy metal shattering bone, or drilling its way through soft flesh looms over me. I think about all the flesh I am made of, how that flesh can come to pieces, how there is a solid skeleton and a weird membrane helping to hold all that flesh in place. The thoughts of this make me have an olfactory hallucination of the odor of blood hanging in the air. These thoughts are not particularly distressing or disturbing, they just enter my head matter of factly and demand my fixation. I am so grateful to have all my limbs and flesh and bones intact. I am so grateful I have never been grievously wounded.\nThe other violent fixation comes from a time when I was on 4-HO-MET and a friend sent me a video of someone stepping on a landmine. The thought of an explosion shredding my leg with shrapnel and spraying that shrapnel across my body haunts me, the thought of the flesh being torn to mangled ribbons, the bone being splintered and fractured and blasted across a distance, it sinks into my mind and I am perpetually remembering it, feeling a twang of pain in my legs, thinking about how lucky I am that I have legs that are intact and functional. This particular thought lingers well throughout the trip and into the next day. I cannot escape or ignore it."

I felt like I could develop thoughts and make connections and associations easier, but it didn’t have that glowing burnt out feeling that other psychedelics had me feeling afterwards. The next day I felt this way too, but like I didn’t feel high or even slightly impaired, I felt like a superior version of myself. Towards the end of the day it began to feel like hypomania, with me becoming extremely talkative and feeling very confident and optimistic. After a point, it almost felt like I was on MDMA, I wanted to talk to everyone and tell everyone nice things. This whole afterglow effect lasted about 36 hours."

It was certainly interesting enough but honestly I can’t really see any reason to pursue it with the intent of tripping except for those who just want to try everything. There are simply so many more interesting and exciting psychedelics out there, that have longer lasting and more punctuated effects. It seems to have value in the increased mental acuity however and the long hypomanic afterglow. I have heard about it being used as a nootropic in low doses and I can definitely see that. ",

I suddenly take immense interest in every little bit of everything I read online and it draws off into an endless tangent of intense focus. I get into reading about a person exploring some mysterious abandoned underground facility. There is a whole thread towards determining what it is. It turns out the big complicated thing was just a mundane old pumping station. It is a huge place and its absurd to think about how much went into building it, only for it to end up abandoned in the isolated French countryside. But in reading the thread there’s a whole lot of discussion about the dangers of exploring underground confined spaces, coming from people all over the various industries that deal with that. The place was apparently extremely dangerous, and there is immense danger in toxic gas build ups in those sort of spaces. People were sharing stories about people who died in septic tanks and sewers and maintenance tunnels its some really unnerving shit. I get caught up in what a painless but crushing death that must be. Accidental death weighs on my mind a lot while tripping, though usually in immensely gory and painful fashion. It is sort of comforting to imagine such a “soft” and painless seeming way out like being overcome by a massively dense and instantly lethal dose of toxic gas."

    "conclusion": "2C-I has been sold under the line “It’s a lot like acid” and I can see why. In terms of headspace and physical effects, it is very similar, although it is more stimulating, and although similar the body high leans more towards other 2Cs. The visuals are also more like the other 2C’s, being very synthetic. For me, LSD’s visuals are a coalescence of organic and synthetic, while this was more purely synthetic. At this dose I was also fairly lucid the entire time, I could operate my phone. The visuals were a great deal of fun though. Also euphoria presented. Hard to tell if that was from set/setting because this is my only time taking it, although I have a hunch that this drug has a great euphoric aspect, also contributing to it being sold as something similar to MDMA too. Overall I would say this drug is great, I want to test it to see how much bodyload it creates without my precautions, and if it is benign enough with respect to that and with respect to headspace at higher doses, it might make its way into my toolkit for making combinations, likely for situations requiring stimulation and heightened physical control.",

The open eyed visuals resemble large blocky designs and tendrils, tightly intertwining and interlocking in perfect harmony with no space left between them. These present as translucent maroon ghost images overlaying everything. When I close my eyes I am struck with a ghostly afterimage of the world around me, in teal, turquoise, magenta, and pink. This image warps and flows and swirls like dropping a drop of dye into water. My short term memory is somewhat compromised. This is incredibly deep and meditative, when I close my eyes and sink away, I am in a great inky sea of thoughts. Blocky geometric forms parade past and mirror themselves and spin and swirl together. They are all harmonious, and all exact and precise in their movements. It is like a great computer or some sentient being has set out a path and sequence for all of these forms and they follow like perfectly rehearsed dancers, just for the pleasure of my viewing.

MXM was coherent memories, and MXP was being vibrated into incoherent waves. But this, this feels like the aether around me is in perpetual and frantic motion. It feels like the boundaries of the hole are in perpetual flux, constantly self-transforming and moving. If I were to give it a characteristic color, it would be dull warm colors. Dull oranges, rust, maroons, browns, crimsons, mahogany. My surroundings felt toothy and sharp, and accented with smaller concentric shapes within. On all sides of me were spinning gears, toothy conveyors, twitching and morphing monoliths with angular borders. Not a single soft edge or corner was in sight, it was all very sharp and angular. It was like being in a jungle of shapes, some huge, some small, but all were in frantic motion. It felt like I was not drifting through this space, rather sitting completely still and having it move around me. This space was mindless yet warm. It was not the cold sterility of ketamine, but also not the warm adventurousness of MXE. It was certainly sterile, but it wasn’t cold, it wasn’t that dissociative feeling of having consumed some chemical ice. The motion and energy of the surroundings seemed to give off a sterile warmth, like a toaster oven or the coils of a space heater or the heat from a car engine.\n"

My friend (also the only other person I know who is so into 3-MeO-PCP) messages me. He said he has just managed to hole on the substance for the first time. We strike up conversation and compare notes. Really strange that we just completely uncoordinatedly did this at the same time. I hope he wasn’t driven to it by a fit of depression. I forget his circumstances, if I recall correctly he achieved it by stacking doses with some weed potentiation. We both had similar duration, and the visual aspect was of a similar nature for both of us-toothy and angular. Very very interesting. I am feeling so stoked, I haven’t read much about holing on this substance on the internet. I feel like I have broken down a barrier, explored a new frontier. I am so hype and so weirdly proud of myself. I decide to follow up with a personal project-Sorting a sample of insect specimens collected in a trap that I received from a museum where I used to work. This is a blast, I feel so happy pursuing something I love, and then there is the social and arrogant aspect of it, that I am doing something unique that will make me look interesting and appealing. All I want to do is appear unique, to receive validation to counter the emptiness and self-loathing so deeply rooted in my mind.\n"

I feel so shy and afraid. I feel like I am failing to be a good friend and good support, and its just pushing me further down into a hole of meekness and weakness.

    "conclusion": "Well interesting discovery. I’m not sure if its easy to hole on 3-MeO-PCP by itself. It seems like you need some sort of potentiator, maybe a smidgen of psychedelics. A lot of weed seemed to really do the trick though. From what I’ve heard pushing doses with 3-MeO-PCP doesn’t put you in a hole but overloads you with mania and racing thoughts that can push one into a scary dissociative psychosis. So I would assume potentiators are the key here, and that is certainly a much safer way to experiment with it it seems. In this case though, can the hole truly be considered a 3-MeO-PCP hole? With my most absurd weed highs (multiple edibles, smoking really relaly dank weed after a long t break, etc) there was certainly a hole-like experience with visuals (visuals that seemed to feature angular shapes and gears most of all, oddly enough). So perhaps you can’t truly and purely hole on 3-MeO-PCP, but this was a combination weed/3-MeO-PCP hole with each drug amplifying the effects and visual aspects of one another. Easier just to call it the 3-Hole or something.",

After a lot of confused back and forth wandering around my apartment, I found the quartz bucket I use for it, which had some melted DMT and maybe 10mg of powder in it already. I cleared a space on my kitchen table (my usual spot to smoke it), and did some stretches and deep breaths. I got down on my knees before a black upside-down cross that is on my apartment wall, and began to pray to Frogmodai, my personal meme deity and embodiment of the the union of entropy and complexification, chaos and order. I turned off all the lights and lit a red candle we have in a tall cast iron candle stick. As I reflected on what I was about to experience, I noticed that it was dark and foggy outside. My apartment is adjacent to a swamp, so with the cross, prayers, candle, fog, and impending DMT I felt very witchy and mystical and could not stop laughing about it. I settled down and took a hit of the DMT. It was not a large amount but it was enough to kick the holographic visuals into gear. There were rainbow symbols on every surface, and I was transfixed especially by the candle, which had symbols streaming off in every direction. When I put my head down I saw lots of blue/green wheel shapes with white details rolling and flying around each other as they left cylindrical trails. This transitioned to more green structures, specifically spherical shaped resembling frogs. Behind the frogs were enormous 4- and 5-plane rotational symmetry, folding in and around themselves. The texture resembled the greebled spaceships in Star Wars."

I went to take a seat and try to act human. The tables and benches were fake wood, and as I stared at them I noticed strong drifting and that they resembled the surface of Saturn.

Each note sounds perfectly placed, each tone resonates with vibrancy and depth. The elements of the music flow alongside one another and are distinct and discernible, yet at the same time they coalesce and unite into one glorious mosaic. I continue to read for a good while, taking in more and more information like a sponge. I am a filter feeder in this sea, picking out little particles of information from the tides swelling past me.  I am shaking a great deal and feel absolutely fantastic. This is much more euphoric than its close cousin, 4-HO-MiPT. I want to socialize and share this feeling with others, it’s a profound warmth with a touch of that overwrought empathogenesis, but not too much. I just feel excited about everything.

I begin talking to some of my friends on chat and feel a perceived heightened emotional depth. Like I am able to empathize flawlessly with their emotional states and respond in accordance to that. The conversations are deep and honest and don’t appear to be fraught with any specific transgressions. It feels like I am able to speak on the same wavelengths as the minds of my friends, as if I am providing a secondary version of them that they can bounce ideas and thoughts off of. This of course, may have been a hallucinated sense of empathy, a hallucinated sense of social competence, but the results seem to hint at some degree of proper understanding."

    "conclusion": " This may now take the throne as my new favorite psychedelic (behind LSD of course). The headspace is nothing short of delightful- it’s whimsical, empathogenic, and feels overall like a pleasant dream. It’s mentally stimulating and makes me want to do things, learn things, absorb information and stimuli for no reason other than the joy of knowledge. The sensory effects aren’t too powerful but still enjoyable and interesting, particularly in the way that they seem to be living, writhing creatures. The bodyload is a bit rough, at least when sitting still, but I found on a later date that walking around and staying active throughout the trip alleviates it to a degree. The empathogenic effects at the tail end of the peak were also a perk, hearkening to my experiences with 4-AcO-MET. Overall I found it very similar to 4-HO-MiPT, in that the essence of the trip was an ostensibly similar creeping feeling that gave way to deep mental stimulation and rational insight, with very organic visuals. The visual aspect of 4-AcO-MiPT presented as being “larger” and less intricate than it’s 4-HO counterpart, and 4-AcO-MiPT presented a unique empathogenic expert that its sibling lacked. ",

        "description": "When I started tripping, me and my girlfriend were listening to ‘Any Colour You Like’ by Pink Floyd, and we could see the cascading synth lines as fibres of light falling over our vision in time to the music. After a little while I became very aware of my throat; I could feel my windpipe and all my veins, and I was not getting a satisfactory amount of air as I was lying down with my head quite high up (on some pillows). When I moved my head it felt like all the tubes in my throat were getting tangled and folded, so I went into the living room to sit upright. I was lost in thought, and somehow came to the realisation that I was dying; I had just ingested a research chemical, made by people I’ve never known about in a lab somewhere I’ve never seen, and I was convinced that I had taken one risk too many by ingesting these chemicals. I started to get worried, and told my girlfriend I was dying (she tried reassuring me), and tried to call my friend to warn him not to take any more, blah blah. I didn’t die and I felt like a drama queen afterwards.\n\nThe rest of the trip, despite thinking I was about to die, was nice and reassuring; in the end, it took away my fear of death. At the time I was dwelling on the things I’d never achieved in my life, but since then I’ve quit the job I hated, went travelling, and made my life a bit better overall. When I was tripping I was convinced that I was going to become a part of the universe; I would live on forever as an integral part of space and time, as part of the background radiation of the universe or as a part of its static.\n\nI was listening to some classical Indian music, one with some chanting in it, and the song morphed into a goatrance song (though not in reality), and I clearly heard a gruff man’s voice say “We. Are. One.” This was it. I said my goodbyes to my girlfriend, closed my eyes, and fell forward onto the bed I was sitting on, and the visuals changed from magnificent colors and gently became grey and cloud-like; like a mix of grey clouds and TV static, when the TV is between channels. I thought this was the cosmic radiation I was meant to be part of, but I think it was just intense ego death as I don’t remember any more of it, and I was sober after."

The further I am pulled into this darkened space the more I forget who I am, and the more intense the hallucinations become.\n\nI remember acknowledging this six years ago as a teenager but had since forgotten that this was the case. I find it fascinating that even after all these years, the subtle effects of a  hallucinogen can be so precisely the same in every way that it jogs my memory to recall previously forgotten experiences.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Visual drifting is now quite intense; my entire visual field looks like everything is in motion, rhythmically swaying, breathing and drifting. Geometry has intensified to level 6 and is overlayed on my vision. I'm also experiencing strong level tracers, moving my eyes causes the environment to streak and blur until I focus on a certain point. \n\nThe body high is now positively electric; it feels like energy is coursing throughout my body in a strong tingling/vibrating feeling that flows through me. It causes my limbs to twitch and move slightly, and my muscles are increasingly/unconsciously tightening and relaxing. I can now stare at one point and have geometry gradually overtake my vision until it is unrecognizable. If I meditate and focus on my experience, I drift into ego death. The overstimulated feeling is gone, and instead, I feel relaxed and sleepy like I’m in a dreamlike state. Laying down and letting visuals overtake me feels natural."

        "description": "Trip has gotten insanely intense at this point. This is likely from the weed and a delayed come up on 2ce. Laying down watching visuals would put me into ego death within several seconds to a minute. The geometry was level 7 at this point and would immediately overtake my vision if I watched them. It was incredibly hallucinatory, with high-level internal hallucinations blending with geometry and building on top of it. It felt like my brain was recursively hallucinating, hallucinations quickly built on top of hallucinated content in a constant stream of visual data.\n\n\nAt points, I was sexually aroused, partly by the very euphoric body high. Any sort of sexual stimulation did not seem appealing, but this caused hallucinations that involved kinks of mine and happened to what felt like the idealised version of my body. This continued for a bit; I was aware of the hallucinatory content but not that it was hallucinations or that it was coming from me tripping. I also experienced sci-fi, and alternate history-themed hallucinations, such as being led through a futuristic club full of transhumans of different sorts, and being part of a resistance movement in a fictional universe where the Nazis won WW2. The body high at this point was very intense but not uncomfortable. The sensation was intense in a mostly neutral sense, but nonetheless somewhat euphoric.\n\n\nDuring brief moments of lucidity in which I remembered I was tripping, I would smoke more weed then lay back down. Ego death was near constant but with some small interludes where I would remember where and who I was, often triggered by a spasm or twitch of my physical body that would ground me back with my senses.\n\n\nI felt clearheaded and alert during the hallucinations and did not feel cognitive impairment of the sort I’d expect from a tryptamine. I had acute and detailed tactile hallucinations of a sexual nature. My arousal felt like it was being caused by the intense body high and hallucinated tactile sensations. At one point, I felt near orgasm until I was pulled out of the hallucination by a distraction in the external environment.\n\n\nThere was little introspection or reflection on my life, the external world, etc. What thoughts I did have were in response to the hallucinatory experiences I was having. Weed did not seem to alter the headspace of the trip much. It did not tend to make it more delusional, as it would a lysergamide or tryptamine. Weed instead just made the visuals much more intense, not categorically different, and made the headspace a bit more relaxing and dreamy."

We talk, and in between saying things, I drift almost immediately back into trancelike ego suppression and geometry, and hallucinations stack up in my vision. At one point I am sitting on the couch and staring at my leggings with the room in my peripheral vision. As my vision stays fixed at one point, the background morphs into being a coffee shop, then an art studio. This transformation happens with my eyes open and seems to happen without the individual objects morphing or changing, but my brain reinterpreting what they are due to not being grounded by short-term memory. Despite this, when Josie says something, it brings me back to the present, and I am coherent enough to respond seamlessly. I am starting to experience increasingly strong sedation as the trip has worn me out. I am not getting analysis suppression but am getting extreme thought disorganisation and thought suppression. "

In terms of discomfort, I would even rank it up there with some of my DPH trips. In the future, I will not be ingesting this compound again without first making a purified tincture from my large collection of morning glory seeds. I am hoping that this will perhaps offset many of the side effects.\n\nIn the meantime, I now consider this trip to be a partially failed experiment. This is due to being forced to combine it with other substances which sullied the documentation process. However, it was still useful for learning more about LSA and how I should approach this compound in the sure.\n\nThanks for reading.",

The slide into this trip is gradual and continuous- it seems like every song sounds deeper than the last. Perhaps this is a perceptual illusion, like a Shepard’s tone, but what isn’t a perceptual illusion while tripping? Are the effects asymptotic? At what point will they level out? Only the passage of time will answer these questions. However just when I think I am following a predictable slide into the bubbling cauldron of effects, new perceptions begin to manifest-\nThere is slight warping at the edges of my vision, like viewing the world through a glass disc, curved around its rim. It is subtle but definitely noticeable. This was entirely absent with a lower dose.  \nSoon the auditory changes are not characterized only by a drop in tone, but also by a sense of bending and flanging and whirling and warping. It feels analogous to how the visual effects of psychedelics alter base visual perception- the ways in which my visual input would be altered have transposed themselves onto my auditory stimuli. Perhaps if I had more understanding of sound, tone, and music theory, I would be able to discern patterns and structures similar to the patterns and superstructures present in the visual perceptions of more standard psychedelics. To my mind however, it is simply a chaotic and esoteric shakedown of my sensory experience. The timbre of everything simply sounds “broken” for lack of any better description- it all feels so wrong, yet it is simply the experience I have subjected myself to, and I am content to accept that.\nThe bodyload sits atop the trip like a gargoyle, unpleasant but entirely manageable. The nausea is bubbling and tense, as if the churning of my stomach has a magnetic energy that pulls my muscles inwards towards it, taut and unnerving."

I felt elated and euphoric and wanted to communicate this enthusiasm with everybody I knew, as if the drug had an empathogenic effect. This time around however, the novelty has worn off and the experience is very matter of fact- merely existing before me. Perhaps all of the euphoria, the excitement, the sociability from last time was just a result of being enthralled at the novelty of the experience. I am decidedly content with the experience I am having now but am not feeling much beyond that.\nCognitively I am still largely functional, typing the same, existing the same, I could probably pass for sober in most contexts were I not so weirded out and distracted by the alterations to sound."

While listening to more music I notice the flanging effect is less noted through headphones than through speakers, as if the distance the sound travels through the air gives it a greater capacity for the drug to wrangle it and bend it out of shape. Another odd effect is music with voices that have been pitched up now sound completely normal- this shouldn’t be surprising or interesting in the least, it was entirely expected, but it was interesting to observe.

It felt as though there was a jet of light and energy erupting from my mind into the sky above, the clouds gathering around me and radiating around it, the earth in concentric circles around my being. It was a sense of incredible self indulgent energy coupled with a sense of being indelibly bound to my surroundings. The afternoon sky's stratus blankets stalked in concentric rings as traceries of light began to weave themselves with their undulating forms. The stone beneath me spoke of the eons it had inhabited and the tension of its tightly bonded crystalline structures. The grass and soil beneath me whispered tales of its drama and struggles, of the creatures that devoured each other and cells lysing and being lysed and passing their nutrients onto other living, metabolizing cells. The trees that shrouded the earth heaved sighs of the wind that tickled their leaves, the larvae that wriggled into their bark, the sunlight that adorned them with photosynthetic energy, the rains that quenched their thirst, the roots tangled in an intimate playdate with the soil, and the incomprehensible beauty of their uncontrollably unpredictable branching forms. So much of the world around me, so much of it so densely tangled and intermingling, and there was me, an interloper, both out of place among their calculated interactions yet inextricably intertwined and exactly where I needed to be.\n"

I observed this giant closely and intimately, gazing upon the lichens and molds and slime molds and mosses that had gathered on its bark, imagining the intricate microcosms contained on its being, the lives so delicately and uncontrollably intertwined with its own. My mind became enraptured with the idea of microcosms and I became engrossed in quietly observing all the tiny things that crawled among its roots and lived out their daily struggle for life and death in a space of less than a square foot. It was absurd to imagine all this life that adapted and radiated and diversified just to arrive at the current time- a plethora of forms recycling nutrients and propagating themselves on this tree in so many different ways, eking out every last bit of the sun's energy and the earth's boundless assemblage of molecules.

I felt like I was being uncontrollably subjected to their radiance, their pulses of life and their respiratory byproducts as they traversed the air around me, an entire thrumming prismatic shower of life. I was so enthralled by my surroundings that I didn't notice another person was in the woods too, also aimlessly wandering. I quickly retreated deeper and out of sight, before I could be seen. I was intractably locked into this mindset now of being enmeshed with these microcosms around me that being suddenly dunked back into the reality of a human existence with other people was very jarring. I don't know why I was so anxious about seeing another person, perhaps I had lost my sense of self among all the plants and fungi and was scared of how it may be expressed.

The trip had manifested itself into alternating waves of sensation- a crest of nervous stimulation, physical discomfort, and an echoing, creeping throbbing and reverberation of my senses, coupled with troughs of stillness, peace, tranquility, and a quiet trickling of gently altered sensations down my neurons. To what degree this was guided by the setting I could not confidently determine. I was amidst the grand necropolis, smoking cannabis enshrined on all sides by tombs and obelisks and towering mausoleums. A tranquility has settled over the land like a mist at dawn. Immediately prior to this I was feeling very exhausted, too warm, too sweaty, and dehydrated. I had to suppress a burgeoning sense of panic at how off kilter my body's equilibrium seemed to have become. But resting, drinking water, smoking, taking in the pleasantries of a cool breeze- it was invigorating and I felt myself on the upswing, physically, mentally, emotionally. I am so comfortable and tranquil that it seems to override the inherent stimulation of the chemical- I could fall asleep here, a soft fortress formed from the curtains of the birds and bugs singing in a chorus around me, cushioned by the pulses of their neutral impulses and respiratory byproducts. I lie at the base of a mausoleum for a while, gazing into the sky, watching paisley traceries manifest themselves from the clouds. They form and unform in a continuous stream, like the birth and death of some very ephemeral organism. I see more people approaching also seemingly aimlessly wandering and feel a quick shock of anxiety, as I must look very out of wack lying here on this tomb, falling asleep. I jolt myself up and make a quick retreat into another wooded section of the cemetery before I can be spotted. \n"

I ducked into some dense bushes to get there, a barely discernible path through the undergrowth seemingly enshrined by the arches of vines and bushes above it, a green trail into a living, breathing oblivion. All of the walking had turned me sweaty and tired and I felt the sense of panic at the disturbance of my homeostasis again. I rested a bit to try and restore order. I spent a while in the woods, gazing closely at mushrooms and molds and other organisms that were hard at work decomposing fallen trees. As I wandered deeper into the woods, deeper into desolation, I felt pangs of fear at my isolation- indeed what would happen if I encountered someone else in this lonely place? I was fairly far into a muddy swamp when I decided to turn back- I had quietly become consumed by a unique panic and fear that my mind could only form when afflicted with such a dense chemical stimulation. Upon returning to the open cemetery I lay on a pathway and gazed longer into the sky, focusing on the visual aspect of the trip- the clouds forming into paisley mirror images of themselves and echoing into oblivion, reverberating to the horizon, their fringes and gaps awash with swirling fluxes of color. The sky is undulating and breathing and there are so many infinitely flowing and warping patterns that are folding themselves out of the disorder. Indeed this trip seems to be tangled in the contradictions of order and disorder- of the apparent disorder of the natural world around me, despite it all functioning along very clear lines of chemical and physical interactions, just so many tangles and threads that is beyond the scope of our understanding of order, the visualization of it all as microcosms as an attempt to turn the intricately assembled ecosystems into neatly compartmentalized closed systems- it's all so much and I am thinking so much and I honestly just need to chill. It's such a nice place to think though. The clouds are not formed into entities or conscious patterns or hallucinations, it's all so abstract, like the self propagating molecules that would soon give rise to life vs. the coherent forms of the organisms they would eventually assemble.

I was immersed deep in contemplation throughout most of the experience, and I would consider this a potent introspective and analytical tool. Stimulation and bodyload wasn't out of the ordinary and there wasn't any particularly unique character to the visuals. To my discretion, there wasn't much to distinguish this from standard LSD, but perhaps further study is required. It nonetheless yielded an enjoyable and valuable experience. ",

More strange beeping and chirping noises begin to crawl out of the corners of my auditory environment, entering my ears and bouncing off each other and dancing and synesthizing into visuals around me. For the next half hour or so I alternate between using the computer and lying on my bed when the body load comes back. I notice it coming in waves and alternating in strength. Eventually, the people I'm talking to begin to drop off and go to sleep. At one point I'm lying on my bed, my laptop is closed and my phone is no longer buzzing, and I suddenly feel so alone. The last time I tripped alone in my room I was talking to people until sunrise. This time however, there is no one, and nothing. I suddenly realize how alone I feel without technology.

I run upstairs and grab my cat on the way up, his fur swirling and warping. Climbing the stairs in the dark holding a cat while tripping too hard to have balance proves to be exceedingly stressful. I pretty much hold my breath the whole way up, heart racing with what is probably unhealthy intensity. By the time I finally reach the top, I have to collapse in a chair and I am hyperventilating. In the darkness of my room, my cat's entire substance soon becomes a field of chomping teeth, sinister and dark. This freaks me out so I put him down, but the hallucination spreads, and all around me in the dark are mouths of glimmering white and faintly red teeth biting at me.

But I soon find out that I am pretty much able to witness her entire life unfold on this one piece of social media. I watch her begin as an innocent teenager taking pictures of her pets, who then gets really into partying and raving. Soon are pictures of bong hits and acid tabs and sweaty scantily clad people at music festivals. Then pictures of large sums of money from dealing drugs and stripping, and the large amounts of drugs she moved. Then her as a full time professional stripper. I just found it so fascinating and I connected so empathically with this random person. It amazed me how easy it was to witness every detail of a total stranger’s life, and I was just amazed at how it felt like I knew exactly how her life unfolded. The most absurd part is through all of this, I wasn’t even able to discern what her name was. Bodyload is all but gone at this point. Visuals still powerful and universal.

I would use this to go on an adventure somewhere to make the world look more interesting. I would take it again, just for how it alters perception. Cognitive and emotional effects were interesting and noteworthy but don't seem to contribute developmentally. It lasts longer than the NBOMe's I’ve taken too which was nice. I also noticed that unlike NBOMe's, which usually prey on my self loathing and intensify it, this one had more a confidence and reasonable remorse effect, where it didn't just cast unfounded hatred upon myself but made me feel more empathetically and justifiably wrong about things that needed to be addressed.",

The visuals are beginning to really pick up as patterns of various interlocking parallel lines begin to form on every surface, flashing in lime green and magenta. Oddly enough there are fewer visuals when I close my eyes. The patterns dance and morph on every surface, structured to fit the forms of everything as defined by shifts in value. Its as though the contrast of the world was raised, casting every form into zones of gradation, and the patterns molded to the shape of each zone. People join me on the platform, the odd late night crew of people who ride the subway at 3 AM. They seem so strange, I feel like I deconstruct their existence by staring at them, I wonder what story has brought them to this place in this moment.

Closed eye visuals ended up not being interesting though, so I simply zoned out and took in the world with a thousand-yard stare. Patterns resembling the organized scribbling of graffiti (especially the ‘wicked’ style originating from and prominent in this city) appeared on every surface, giving the subway the appearance of one of those subway cars from New York in the late 70’s, the insides completely saturated with scrawlings. It felt like I had unlocked a hidden world, that the encoded messages of the spirits etched on every surface, normally beyond or below our perception, had been illuminated. It was as if they were basic notes and commentary guiding every object, or the source code underlying existence. I entertained this idea for a bit, letting it chew on my mind and enter the territory of full delusion that normally only arises from dissociatives. The sounds of the train shooting through the tunnels are spectacular and entertaining, further adding to the cyberpunk surreality I have subjected myself to. It definitely feels worth it now."

Everything the powder touches inside my face burned and stung, I felt sniffly and teary and extremely uncomfortable for a good bit. 2C-B is super colorful and visual, and it can be deep and profound if I let it. If I so desire, I can also just feel euphoric and interact with people, as social skills are not really degraded in any way. ",

I notice how filthy my living space is- not just the mess strewn about but the actual filth in the carpet, the fact that I haven’t vacuumed this room for a whole year. This bothers me for the first time ever. What proceeds is a manic cleaning fit, literally refusing to afford myself even a second of rest or immobility. I clean up all the mess and organize all of my things, working up a substantial sweat and winding my frail body in the process. I then get to vacuuming every inch of the room, frantically and frenetically dragging the vacuum around the room and cleaning the filth like my life depended on it. It felt so great to do this, simply the knowledge that I managed to finally motivate myself to make my living conditions acceptable. That I not only saw fit to do so, but actually accomplished the task too. My work done, I threw myself onto my bed and breathed myself a sigh of relief in my nice clean room. I imagine this is what Adderall is like for people, only I had wonderful rainbow visuals dancing in the corners of my vision and pulsing through the entire clean space.

I lose track of everything becoming engrossed in strange chains of thoughts about strange things, and from there the strange associations that generate new strange thoughts about strange things in strange places. It’s so incredibly surreal but feels so natural. I become aware of how totally dissociated from reality me and these thought processes are, yet it still feels so natural, just a total paradigm shift. My mind has accepted these new conditions with open arms, and denies that any other mode of thought could exist. The CEV’s are incredibly mechanical, not even sharp and synthetic but very literally machine like, at times seeming like biomachines with insect legs and at other times being purely geometric pieces moving in unison with one another to make great intricate machines and fields of circuitry.

This is chiefly in the timing- you come up fast and hard, you get faceplanted into the experience from the top of a 12 story building, rather than the slow descent the oral ROA gives you. Not to mention the incredibly pain of snorting them. With 2C-I, the contrast seems to manifest at a deeper level. The intense focus I had felt was entirely unique among all the drugs I have tried. I imagine a good dose of regular stimulants would be like this for most people, but this had the added benefit of psychedelic visuals and the psychedelic headspace. 2C-I has been cemented as a powerful tool of self-augmentation to me, both physically and mentally. It improves all of my functions to various degrees in various ways and will certainly serve me well in the future.",

While walking it almost felt as though my body could not keep up with my mind, as if I had some projection in my mind of arriving home faster but that projection went beyond my physical capabilities.\nI smoke a joint immediately upon arriving home. The nausea that was somewhat apparent the last time I took this has not been an issue, but I do notice some other painful abdominal cramps and a bit of a twisting discomfort all throughout my body. I am very wired and shaking very hard. I chew some gum to quell the jaw clenching. My thoughts are flowing quickly and efficiently, and I find myself spending a great deal of time just reading about whatever catches my interest on the internet, similar to how many other psychedelics manifest for me. The open eyed visuals are picking up, while the closed eyed visuals are curiously relatively faint. With my eyes closed, there appear great checkerboard diamonds radiating their patterns into infinity and pulsing in the aether. The open eyed visuals are like a tangled web of roots or mycelium, dancing and intertwining with itself across every surface, its form seemingly following some sort of mathematical or fractal patterning. They nestle themselves into formation while pulsing and flashing with waves of purple and teal. Soon my entire visual field is shaking, as if the world is coming apart at the atoms, as if these webs have woven their way deep into the fabric of existence and are slowly splitting it apart like how water seeps into cracks and freezes to cleave rocks apart. It is as though the world is screaming from being torn apart, but the fundamental deconstruction of all things has subdued this scream to a muffled shout. While I am very altered, I also still feel very grounded and lucid and functional in some sense. Perhaps my entire frame of reference has been shifted aside into some esoteric realm and my “grounded” is objectively cast into some distant space. The visual circuitry that has been disseminating throughout my sensory field seems to crackle and sizzle, searing cancer into reality, belching out plumes of smoke from the charred fabric of every intertwined atom.

It still looks like everything is foggy and smoky, and the air outside of the warm confines of my room chills me to the bone.  Being in a well-lit space surrounded by other people is very disorienting. I thought I was mostly down but the sudden immersion in a new environment makes me realize just how hard I am still tripping. Conversation initially is awkward and difficult, however as time goes on I find myself more capable. It’s similar to jumping into cold water and slowly acclimating to the temperature. I am hearing and feeling this crackling sensation in my inner ears, especially while I am talking or if I have my mouth open. This fades after about an hour but is certainly novel and mysterious."

They mostly appear as those same labyrinthine laceworks that swirl and twist and dance on any flat surface. I find myself much more able to do social interaction now, in fact I find myself more able to than when I am sober, a typical effect of psychedelics. We watch this absurd Kung-Fu movie I picked up from a souvenir shop in Chinatown, with incomprehensible subtitles, an incoherent plot, and absolutely absurd acting and visual effects. It’s one of the most entertaining and baffling things I have ever seen and the comedown of the drug has certainly enhanced that. While the trip winds down, the urinary effects have only gotten worse. I find myself laden with chills and overall discomfort, but the bladder pain is certainly the worst aspect of it all."

I feel feverish and sweaty all day and have a great deal of trouble regulating my temperature. This sucks a lot. I have almost no appetite and can barely eat all day. I give myself a heavy cocktail of sedatives around bedtime so I don’t have to toss and turn while suffering through this again. I feel better the next day."

    "conclusion": "This drug is okay at best. The last time I tried it at 30 mg I barely had threshold effects, but the urinary symptoms presented in full force. At that time, I had been experiencing less acute versions of those symptoms for some time before the experience, so I was hesitant to blame the drug. This time however, demonstrated that the drug was definitely responsible for exacerbating that state, and it seems it is quite capable of inducing those symptoms in me when they weren’t already present. The headspace was interesting enough but not particularly unique. I could get the same thing from other 2C’s without the horrible toxic effects on my body. The only part that stood out as pleasant was the comeup before the bodyload really kicked in. The sensory effects weren’t particularly interesting either, with only moderate and fairly abstract visuals. The whole trip felt like being seared by a cold toxic fire. One thing to note is that both times I took this drug I didn’t feel like I was tripping very hard, but in retrospect I realized how separated from my consciousness I really was. This one has a very long and very gradual comeup that immerses one into the experience so slowly that they may not even notice when it starts to really come on.",

One thought leads to another, and another, and they all beautifully bloom into the next one. Suddenly I realize that I have drifted off. The entire flowing structure of thought processes collapses as I jerk myself back into reality. I open my eyes. The ceiling is an abyss of swirling fractals and forms and faces made of dancing and swirling fractals. Every object in the room loses its defined edges as I stand up. Every boundary of my vision is spiraling away into infinity. I sit down at the computer and slowly regain lucidity."

As I drift away from the corporeal world into darkness, I am addressed by a booming voice, from what I can deduce it is the voice of this grand bear of my mind. \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING\". What followed was a conversation between my nervous awkward self and some sort of figure of grand authority and overbearing power. My timidity, self loathing, and awkwardness were put on trial in great contrast to the authoritative confidence and self assuredness of this booming voice.

The visuals are large and flashing- they are not overly meticulous and intricate, but rather a harmonious assemblage of larger intertwined and interacting forms and patterns. Not so much nausea anymore as just cramping and aching. Everything feels like its caught in a swirling eddy or twisting whirlwind, everything twists and twirls and rolls as it moves.\nThe closed eyed visuals are spectacular and dissimilar from other phenethylamines I have taken. They are 3-dimensional forms, looking rendered and produced as CGI. It reminds me of dissociatives. Except I am not able to sink into any sort of dissociative state, no matter how hard I meditate. This does not seem to be a drug that lends itself to ego death or total confusion / break with reality. Rather, it seems to anchor me in reality as an absolutely observant form to efficiently process thoughts and stimuli. Behind my eyelids pyramids and cones and prisms and rhombs cast in dramatic stark light shift around in their respective planes. Soon they find themselves coated in checkerboard patterns, their backdrop a swirling tie dye kaleidoscope of swirling dim yet vibrant colors and textures. Forms that resemble greek columns float in from the wings of my vision.\nThe open eyed visuals make me recall my first times doing acid. Semi-biomorphic and pariedoilic forms decorate the walls and ceiling like incredibly intricate and detailed relief carvings. They seem to recede into infinite depth, hallways of textures lined with the stoic chiseled faces of birds and reptilian beings. Every time I move my eyes, a line of tracers follows the object of my focus, like that old windows xp glitch when you tried to drag a window that was not responding. The patterns that form an interstice between these forms are serpentine, angular tendrils and ropes entwining to form intricate laceworks. They are floral, they blossom and ripple with concentric lines. I decide to go outside and play around in my garden."

It enhances perception, it enhances associative rationalizing, it enhances mental efficiency and acuity, it is perfect for aiding introspection, while itself providing an exciting substrate to explore, an infinitely nested scaffolding of absurdity and novelty. However, this comes at a price, it comes at the price of one’s body. Indeed, the nausea I had complained about before still came back in waves. This drug is elegant and reserved in how it will receive visitors. I probably would have been having an awful experience were I not experienced in general. With pain comes wisdom.\nThe visuals are bright, glowing and buzzing with adamantine rainbow auras, they are also eerie, with a thousand pariedoilic faces staring at me everywhere I glance. The CEV world is the same stimmy colorful checkerboard world I described before, and while I canno sink into a dissociated CEV space with my eyes closed, I can get distracted by the silliness and novelty of the drug long enough to lose track of time.

Like replacing the potential for human error with that of an extremely efficient machine. My brain is a computer, processing inputs and responding methodically and meticulously. Thoughts were just branching and blossoming in reaction to one another. Time was a major theme of this meditation, thoughts on my past, on the distant past, thoughts on the distant future and how others experience time. Indeed, time was heavily altered in my state of meditation, I could use the music that was playing as a way to guide this- I would hear it slow down and speed up. My sense of time had become completely arbitrary. I have a headache now. The visuals this time with my eyes closed were intertwining ribbons that embraced and wound around one another. They formed colorful and harmonious patterns, too perfect for this world. My flow of thoughts is lucid, focused, and unclouded. It doesn’t even seem like I have that infectious curiosity that a lot of drugs give me."

The last one, 2C-T-4, doesn’t get as much positive press. They have all been described as powerful, therapeutic, challenging, and introspective. Indeed they are all rough on the body, featuring nausea and vomiting. Their unique composition gives them unique pharmaceutical interactions, mostly stemming from their activity as a weak MAOI. I had a gap in my medications due to fucking up getting a psychiatrist appointment, so I took the opportunity to sample this one while my blood was pure. Infinitely deep and rewarding compound with a lot to offer, and novel headspace, shame it hurts so much though. Its lessons must come through pain. ",

Pulses run through my body and drag its essence along with them, turning my sense of self into a warped, smeared mess.

I really don’t know much about music to be honest though. The same closed eyed visuals are still presenting, still moving as rapidly as my heartbeat, my thoughts, my every movement. If I could describe myself in one word, it would be ‘fast’. The open eyed visuals are simple concentric patterns and a distinct fogginess to my vision, not blurriness but as if my vision was washed out and faded. Cognitively, my thought processes are mostly introspective and self-reflective, as if the burden of trying to orient my excess energy with the outside world is too much and I must turn inwards for any sense of harmony or calm. Even confined to an inner realm however, my thoughts still flit about too quickly for me to catch them, too erratic for me to focus on them or process them. They whizz around nebulously like a swarm of insects. Yet I do not feel anxious in any way.

The smoking stokes the flames of my thought however, and what had been smoldering embers was now ignited into a glistening glowering conflagration. The visuals also became more prominent. A text from someone who couldn’t know I was tripping filled me with racing anxious thoughts about how to deal with the situation and the potential bad outcomes, especially in case of them trying to call me. I decided to calm myself down by hiding upstairs in my room. I was feeling so overstimulated that I decided not even to turn the light on and simply lie there in the darkness. Lying down was overall comfortable, at least at first. However, the agitation in my limbs filled me with this looming sense that I should be up and about. The open eyed visuals were more prominent now, appearing as great spiraling checkerboard fractals, rapidly spinning and morphing and pulsing and radiating in the dark, not in any bright colors but in muted cool tones. Everything seemed to have a rippling magenta aura. I became locked in introspection as I was tossing and turning on my bed, struggling to find any one position comfortable for long. My thoughts often turned dark and pessimistic and I was often struggling to reconcile my existence with the amount of suffering others experienced and potential suffering I could experience. My thoughts were always grounded and pragmatic though, and never risked spiraling out of control. I also found myself having to urinate quite frequently, sometimes encountering urinary retention despite this. After going I decided to rejoin my friends downstairs."

I feel tweaked out, like the energy I had previously that I could devote to making verbose conversation had burned away and left me feeling lazy and slurred. Despite this I still physically felt very stimulated and speedy. After they leave, another friend arrives and doses LSD, adding to the collective madness of the setting. My one friend is heavily dissociated and loudly repeating words while my other is content to sit and stare blankly upwards, while yet another seems to be receding from reality all together. We play super smash bros, I find my ability somewhat improved, perhaps due to a faster reflex time and faster, twitchier fine motor movements for pressing buttons."

I take them upstairs to give them a change of clothes and find they are lapsing in and out of being responsive and that they seem at times entirely unaware of the outside world. They are completely disconnected from reality and any sense of consequence, and that’s when I realize this person needs to be watched over by a sitter. I feel lucid enough to take up the role and also deal with the cleanup of the mess. Somehow I manage to quickly, calmly, and competently accomplish all of this, beyond my expectations of my functionality in any state. I end up having to knock my friend out with benzos and sedatives as their trip seemed to have taken a sour turn and they had wished for it to end quickly. After they are safely asleep I rejoin my other friends downstairs who seem a bit freaked out by what happened. The nausea has returned and is coming in waves again."

The shaking has not let up either, though I have my motor skills about me enough to roll a blunt by this point. Through the next few hours I feel the familiar pleasant feeling of a psychedelic afterglow, though the physical effects have only barely decreased from peak levels. I can form thoughts more eloquently and make connections better than normal, I feel witty, funny, competent, smart and confident. It feels deep and not superficial, and hanging out with my friends feels great as we joke and laugh all night. I do eventually feel like I have grown exhausting, to myself and others. I end up going to bed very late into the night despite having to wake up somewhat early the next day."

I am still shaking a bit and the agitation still resides in my limbs, making it uncomfortable to sit still for too long. Mentally I feel drowsy and worn out all day, even after taking a nap.

The amount of tremors and muscle agitation was unreal, though all of that would probably have felt more manageable if I was walking around or doing something other than sitting in my house all day. The nausea and stomach/abdominal cramps were definitely prominent throughout the experience, coming in waves and lingering like a slow burn well into the next day. There did not seem to be any empathogenic effects. There was mild cognitive enhancement with thoughts geared towards introspection. The visuals were very mild and unremarkable. Overall it was really not much more than a novel experience and I don’t see myself taking it again for any reason. ",

My body would just fade when I closed my eyes, no pleasurable tactile sensations, just total absence. It felt like my mind was forming a gravity well and sinking into existence. Any attempts at using some internal narration failed, it was as if my ability to use words had just died. I rode this out for about an hour and then went outside to listen to music and enjoy the sky. There were those same swirly tendril patterns in the sky and more flashes of color, some of them corresponding to the forms of the patterns. The tactile sensations had more or less faded. Music was fascinating, it was like the feeling I get from listening to music stoned where I can pick out every sound and every layer of carefully placed instruments and voices, but amplified tenfold, I could intensify my focus on certain elements of the soundscape and isolate them in my mind."

They are incomparable to other psychedelics for several reasons- The first is a lack of sensory stimulation and distortions until higher doses are reached, and even then the effects are subtle and odd. They do not follow the patterns or harmonies of traditional psychedelic visual effects- rather they are vague, disconnected, and extremely abstract. The headspace is unlike anything else, it’s a blank neutrality and a sense of suppression of the normal channels of psychedelic thought. It’s not entirely as though these chains of thought have been rendered blank, but rather they have been rerouted into esoteric territory that defies proper comprehension- it’s a profound alteration that leaves the mind unsure of how to react. The physical effects of this drug in particular feature a great deal of stimulation and hallucinated tactile sensations, moreso than any other psychedelic I’ve taken. I’m not entirely sure what utilitarian value I could apply to this substance personally, it’s just so odd. The leg pain on the comedown was interesting too.\n",

I’m ashamed of how I was once a source of pride to my parents, how I was charismatic and bright and now I’m a drugged up loser who is too anxious to leave his room. I’m ashamed of how ive drifted from all of my friends, how I avoid social contact just to trip alone in my room. I’m ashamed of how I’m a depressed weirdo, how I can’t contribute anything to anything, and how it feels like I’ve just trapped myself in a dead end.

This is a familiar feeling that I recognize from experiences with Psilocin and 4-AcO-MET. Auditory hallucinations become overwhelming. Oftentimes It will seem like ambient noises are simply reverberating and trailing off more than usual. Now however, they are not just reverberating and trailing off, but rather completely transforming into strange new sounds, turning my existence into an utter cacophony. Each sound has transformed into something else entirely, and they all dance and play in the air around me. My sense of perspective is annihilated."

I am to cowardly to approach ego death, too anchored to myself, and this world. I have failed again. This reminds me of my experiences with experimenting heavily with acid in earnest last year, where I was constantly taking absurd doses. There was this essence of constsantly pursuing something, a tiny point, a convergence of the fractal landscape my existence had become. But whenever I tried to attain this point, it was pulled away from me in a most heinous Tantalan hell. Something would always pull or push me out of the way, or move it. Perhaps attaining this was the complete dissolution of self, and I simply had too many anchors keeping me just out of reach. Whatever. I lie down under my covers and listen to music.

    "conclusion": "I am trying to settle the debate as to whether 4-AcO tryptamines are active on their own or whether they get completely metabolized into the 4-HO variant, with the experience owing all of its effects to this 4-HO metabolite. Honestly you can’t really settle any debate on the subjective effects of psychedelics though. The psychosomatic effects of set and setting alone can honestly make two experiences of the same drug vastly different, not to mention that whole thing with my declining health from nutrient deficiency. But for me, it was completely different. It lacked the emapthogenic effects of 4-AcO-MET, it lacked the warm euphoria and the delusions of grandeur and confidence only slightly touched upon me. It was substantially more powerful and drifted more towards ego death, while 4-AcO-MET seemed to be entrapment and a total descent into ego. Next up is to compare mushrooms with 4-AcO-DMT. About to tap back into mushrooms wooo, I hope the psychological block of them won’t interfere. I haven’t written about my hellish mushroom experience and it happened so long ago that I really can’t effectively anymore. I almost killed myself though. \nAnyways, 4-HO-MET felt kinda like mushrooms, but without the overwhelming-ness or the destruction of autonomy. I was in control, it was like neutered mushrooms, (not necessarily a bad thing), that was also devoid of the emotional aspects of mushrooms that can very easily spiral out of control.",

It is like all those odd autonomies entities around me have evolved into a grand sentience woven from the twisted fabric of reality, some sort of overmind or undermind hiding and playing in the shadows of our reality. It had used this trip as a chance to manifest in my reality, but it could not simply spontaneously manifest, it had to lay out the pieces and wait for them to evolve and grow into its final form. And at last the incredibly intricate lacework of its veins and nerves, each borne from their own autonomous beings, had formed into a collective being. That was about as far as it could go. Communication was nil. The best way I could describe the feeling was that something was trying to take me somewhere, but I was not entirely sure what, where, or why. It had put so much effort into forming itself into this world, only to fail at the threshold, finding me completely alien and incommunicable. I wonder if a higher dose would connect me to this underlying consciousness somehow?

    "conclusion": "4-HO-DPT like its cousin DPT is an incredibly deep, strange, alien, and biomorphic psychedelic that seems like it has a lot to offer, high doses seem to show the potential for some really interesting entity contact, or perhaps this is best done through combining it with other substances. The major obstacle is the absolutely horrendous ROA and the crippling bodyload. The bodyload is substantially worse than DPT, with awful abdominal aches and cramps and nausea that lasts almost through the entire trip. When the pain finally subsided I felt like I had been dredged and left raw and bare in my pain. Administering it is another hellish ordeal. I have never taken a drug that was so unpleasant to administer. Maybe it’s just this batch but the powder smells and tastes awful, and its so floury that it gets everywhere, and stings whatever it touches. I couldn’t imagine trying to stuff 100 mg or more of this stuff into my face. I tried it orally at 125 mg and felt literally nothing, meaning that if I want to do anything fun with this I’m going to have to snort it. Easily one of the most unpleasant things I’ve snorted, just after MXP.\n\nI had super high expectations for this drug, calling it my holy grail. Psychologically/sensorily it was a very rewarding and interesting experience, but it was hampered by the awful bodyload, which seems like it would also put a cap on further exploration, as it would only increase with dosage. This is a shame, I was really excited to explore this compound and this little taste of it has me even more interested, but I am very put off by the pain and discomfort it also induced. ",

I am shivering violently, part the usual tremors in reaction to most drugs I take, part being really cold. I lie down on a rock and bask in the swirling breathing cold that surrounds me.

The snow is dancing with colors but I feel so sad and disappointed. “same old bullshit, same old same old”\nI walk to the river. The air feels bluer than ever, an icy twilight chill hovering over everything. The entire river is frozen over. Intricate patterns trace through the ice, I’m not sure if these are natural or a result of the drug. I can sense the cold hovering over and coagulating on the icy river. Walking along I decide to sit and ponder and stare at the ice some more. This happens a lot as I walk along the river. It all feels so sad and I don’t know where I’m going to go back to.

Regardless of whether or not I can share these, I know they only exist in my mind and no one else’s. Once I’m dead, those memories, those stories are all gone.

I want to force myself to be productive, to learn something or consume some new and carefully crafted media, or at least something not carefully crafted for my immediate and careless consumption. Something to make the night and the experience more worthwhile.\nI feel emotionally raw and vulnerable- guided therapy would probably be very productive and useful in this state. Particularly by this time, when the intensity of the other effects has tapered down to a more manageable level and I can truly focus on the cognitive and emotional effects. Much of the content I see online now is funny and fills me with mirth. I decide to take a gravity bong hit.\nAn internet tangent soon leads me down an internet hole where I want to lean all the basics about how thunderstorms form and function. I had originally planned to watch an anime that I heard very good things about, as part of consuming some stimulating media (ok I’m a fucking nerd I know), but spent the next hour ravenously reading information about lightning and thunderstorms, and all the necessary background knowledge (like a refresher on how electricity in general works). I feel like the state my mind was in allowed me to form conclusions and analogies from what I was reading and to translate them and structure them into being compatible with my own thought processes in a way that allowed me to readily repeat them.

Compared to DPT and 4-HO-DPT, this is substantially friendlier to dose. The amount of powder is modest and manageable and it doesn’t cause nearly as much discomfort. Also relative to DPT and 4-HO-DPT, this doesn’t carry the same sense of some sentient “other” guiding with or lurking within the trip. This was rational, logical and completely anchored in my self and my own experience. There was no novel and esoteric machinations intersperse among it like its other family members.",

It is not very stimulating at all, and until I redosed there was absolutely no bodyload. In general redosing seemed to greatly increase the negative physical effects with diminishing returns as far as the experience goes. ",

    "introduction": "My girlfriend and I purchased ~50 cream charger canisters that we shared. I’ve been smoking cannabis for almost 6-7 years fairly regularly, but just recently started experimenting with nitrous with a friend 3 weeks ago. This is the first time I’ve continuously dosed this much, this quickly. I was sitting in a chair in my office playing Boards of Canada <https://youtu.be/ftqkP3n2qLU> and reading through PW articles on nitrous, trying to comprehend what I was reading to compare it with what I was feeling. The dissociation was very heavy, making it much more difficult to comprehend everything as I got closer to the peak. The times listed below are flubbed, as my perception of time was heavily altered.\n",

        "description": "Upon inhaling 2 to 5 canisters of N2O continuously, I felt an intense euphoria rush over me. I started to get into laughing fits and my body began to feel fuzzy and light, with tiny vibrations coursing through it. The feeling reached all the way to my toes, but became the most apparent in my hands and face, where they started to lose feeling. Upon taking a hit of N2O in this state, my vision became quickly filled with large circles of blackness, then whiteness. Auditory distortions sounded like white noise and phasers, getting increasingly louder and dampening what was going on around me. The synaesthesia was mild, and I could visualize the white noise pulsing to the beat of songs or sounds in my head. Double vision started to take over and made it incredibly hard to focus on things, while items within my direct line of sight began to drift slowly. In my CEV, I started to see level 2 geometry beginning with small ripples that moved to the beat, while my OEV began to form vague lattices that became harder to pick out and focus on as I dissociated further."

After each hit of nitrous, I experienced the same flash of darkness into light that would completely take over my CEV and OEV. The visual effects were becoming much more apparent, and I was beginning to see drifting and melting effects on level 3 geometric vortexes and ripples inside my head. I stared up at the ceiling in complete awe, watching it drift faster than it had previously before and pulsing with the beat. My body didn’t even feel numb anymore, and instead felt like it was never there to begin with."

        "description": "After the 25th hit, my sense of self was beginning to diminish. I started depersonalizing heavily, imagining that I was viewing my actions and hearing everything I said in third person without entirely leaving my physical form. There was one point where every thought I had, any time I needed to speak, or even when I needed to move, it felt as though I was living my life through my brain and manually sending electrical stimulation and signals needed to get my body to accomplish these tasks. Eventually, after a few more hits, my body was almost entirely autonomous. I could still speak clearly and collect my thoughts enough to get them across in between hits, but it felt like someone else was saying and doing all of this for me. Waving my hands back and forth in front of my face started to produce very distinct tracer effects. The synaesthesia was getting very strong at this point, and I was beginning to see level 4 geometry in my CEV that drifted heavily to the beat of the song."

I laid back in my chair, holding in the final hit, while I experienced the last powerful flash of light/darkness. My head fell backward to look at the ceiling while I closed my eyes. My body felt as though it was slowly drifting/melting into the floor. I hit a short-lived level 2 ego death, losing all sense of where I was or how I got to this point. My perception of time started to slow down more and more. The level 4 geometry filling my CEV began drifting and pulsing to the music even faster, becoming more intense. Suddenly, it felt as if my entire consciousness had been lifted from my body, soaring towards the ceiling into a bright light. \n\nAfter the bright white light disappeared, I was in a room full of a large, complex level 5 geometric shape, spinning in a large circle. In the center, I noticed a large orb of light. It lit up very quickly upon me noticing it, and suddenly filled my vision with another flash of white light, followed by complex geometric shapes that resembled a human face. I heard a voice speak to me. I can't remember specifically the words it used, but vaguely remember that it was telling me to make sure that I checked on my girlfriend. The face started to fold up into itself, disappearing just as quickly as it had appeared, and I was left in the white room we occupied for a short while until my body forced my eyes back open."

It felt like the trip state I was in lasted for 20-30 minutes, when in reality it was only about 15 to 20 seconds. I stood up and moved into the bedroom where my girlfriend was laying down for bed. The visual effects were going in and out in waves. I would be fine for about 20 seconds to a minute without seeing any visuals, then after that period of time I would start to experience more drifting. I laid down to cuddle my girlfriend and stared at the wall. Upon the textured walls, I noticed what looked like the head of a frog. This frog head morphed slightly until it eventually became much bigger, with a wide, gaping mouth. I chuckled at what I was seeing, then sat up to go get a drink of water. I found it very difficult for me to walk in a straight line without bumping into walls. The auditory effects had all but disappeared, but I still had minor visual drifting that progressively became less apparent over the span of 15 minutes. As I came back into the bedroom, I felt as if the room had shrunk in size, or that I had grown larger. This effect continued for about 20 seconds until everything returned to its normal size and perspective."

My brain fog still didn't feel entirely gone, and it felt as though my eyes and mind were still having trouble focusing entirely on things. "

    "conclusion": "I've never gone past 3 or 4 canisters back-to-back until this experience, so this is my first time peaking this hard on Nitrous. I would much rather prefer to stay as high as a few canisters could give me at one time. I find Nitrous is great to do in social settings with close friends, but not to try and peak.\n\nN2O pairs nicely with some other dissociatives or hallucinogens, but I wouldn't recommend chasing this level on Nitrous alone unless you're really curious about what it's like to peak on it. There are far more efficient methods of breaking through.",

        "description": "We went for a walk outside; me, Josikins, and our better halves (who were guiding us). Initially, the chilly air and concrete buildings, the pedestrians talking too loudly for my liking, made me think it was a mistake and I wanted to go back, but my girlfriend assured me that everything was fine so we carried on. I saw more people, who to me looked very aggressive, I saw dog shit on the pavement, and the journey, I knew, was quite a tough walk even sober, so I was very nervous.\n\nWe eventually took a short-cut through a public garden, and I was suddenly in awe at the beauty of the trees, the colors of the flowers, and I was grinning madly then on. The plants smelt amazing. We got to the top of the hill (past the playground, past rowdy teenagers who didn’t even annoy me, as I knew they were just trying to have some fun), and we could see the two big hills of Hastings overlooking the sea, and it was absolutely stunning. I was totally relaxed, we put on some music, sat down, and I started going through Egodeath, though I was fully aware of it and functioned normally.\n\nI heard my own voice talking to me excitedly, and these sentences kept repeating themselves in my mind, overlapping each other, swirling around: “Don’t you see? The Hindus were right all along! They found this state-of-mind thousands of years ago!” “We are one” “I am God, they (my friends) are God, we are all God” “This is the reason we do anything” – ‘this’ being Egodeath/Bliss/Nirvana, and ‘anything’ meaning going to work, getting stressed, paying bills, etc. and “You have reached the absolute pinnacle of existence” – this last sentence kept sounding like it had voice-modulation, the end slowing down but remaining in the same pitch = “pinna-cle of exis-tence…”\n\nI came to the conclusion that, although it felt like I could access the history and future of the universe all at once, it didn’t really matter and all that matters is love; it binds us together, gives life its meaning, and is the very reason for existence. All other concerns came after, which is why I wasn’t all that fussed with trying to uncover impossible facts about the nature of the universe while going through Egodeath: it didn’t really matter. After all, what could I change? So I focused on the idea of love, and tripped absolute balls in bliss.\n\nWe walked on again and watched the sunset. We then went back to the house, and after the chilly walk the warmth of the room was very welcome. I sat down and went through Egodeath again, all the while the phrases were repeating. Though this time my mind was very clear, there weren’t any visuals (just a clear white light), and I let my breathing slow down and eventually stop; I wasn’t holding my breath, I just didn’t need to breathe any more. While I was like this I felt like I was floating slightly off of my chair, suspended in zero gravity. It was an incredibly liberating sensation. Every so often, I breathed normally and looked around, admiring the good company and nice, safe surroundings. I looked at the people in the room one by one, and my voice in my head said things about them. To one guy who wasn’t tripping, it said “trust in him, he’s in your inner circle as well”, to Josikins it said “you owe this person a lot, treat them well”, and to my girlfriend it said “she will be with you forever, love her forever”. Then I’d close my eyes and float again. I gently cried tears of joy, as the love I felt was just so great."

There were no cars on the road, because there were only a few people in existence right now! Though actually I was just coming down and had thought loops, so I thought I was going to go through Egodeath again. I ended the trip being utterly dopey; I went to the bathroom, forgot why I was there, and just stood around for ages. I thought I had done something terrible and felt really guilty. I didn’t sleep as I felt so guilty and needed to piss so badly because I forgot to go while in the bathroom, but I didn’t do anything about it as I thought it was an adequate punishment for some horrible thing I had done. There wasn’t anything I did, of course, I just needed guidance on everything at that point, and I needed help getting undressed and put into bed...\n\nBut hey, what a trip!"

I was only here for a matter of seconds. I then saw a ‘blocky’ wall of light move like a wave from left to right – if ocean waves were on Minecraft they would look like this, very blocky and simple. The wave had a pair of cartoon eyes, like Goofy or Donald Duck or whatever.\n\nAfter this I was drifting from the planet’s surface and ended up looking at a bright orange globe from space. After this I heard someone in the room say something, so I opened my eyes and I saw in splitscreen reality on the upper half, and my DMT trip carrying on without my attention beneath. That was kind of like when you’re swimming in goggles and you lift your head out of the water just enough so that you can see above and below surface. The real world was rather dull in comparison, so I closed my eyes and carried on. I drifted away some more and then saw that the planet was inside a watermelon, vines and all, and I had just exited the planet’s atmosphere like I imagine anything else would, but the atmosphere here was quite clearly a watermelon.

So I think that explains why I then saw an army of cavemen, made entirely of the aforementioned, ever-changing light, carrying a banner of ever-changing color, march proudly towards the orange globe in deep space. I reckon I was convincing myself that DMT and the whole psychedelic experience will carry on as long as there are even a few proponents. After this revelation my trip stopped; reality appeared to have been ‘poured’ over my trip, over my field of vision. There were even vibrantly colored visuals on the extreme periphery of my vision for a few seconds after.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice evening in."

        "description": "I took the dose around 5:20 PM, then joined my roommate (and tripsitter), who wanted to get some food. My friend wanted food from a Chinese restaurant about 20 minutes away. We left at +10minutes. I settled in to the passenger seat. Since 4-aco usually takes about 40 minutes to hit me, I figured we'd be almost home by the time the trip started. I thought the drive would serve the perfect distraction to pass the time.\n\nWe had made about halfway there when I first felt it. The 4-aco gently trickled into my body, its warm glow spreading from my core into my extremities, a familiar friend. I told my roommate I was starting to come up; he asked if I wanted to turn around. \"No\", I said, \"it'll be interesting and I'm feeling comfortable.\" By the time we arrived at the restaurant I was feeling nauseous. Sure enough, when I walked in, the smell from the kitchen was enough to send me reeling. I hurried outside, back to the car, where I could sit comfortably and listen to music.\n\nAs I sat, I wondered how the trip was going to be. I wondered if the dose was going to be what I wanted, slightly paranoid it wouldn't be strong enough. My friend was taking forever to get his food. I didn't think my time perception was already so distorted. It did in fact take a long time, my tripsitter told me when he got back to the car. He seemed to care more about that than I did, happy as I was enjoying the come-up.\n\nWhen we arrived home around 630. I settled down in the dimly lit living room and packed my slider. I took a hit and melted into the couch , enjoying the increasingly pleasurable body high and headspace. Halfway through my second hit, I understood just what I was in for. The peak hit me like a truck. The visuals exploded to life. I saw people and places both new and familiar embedded within the geometry Midway through the 2nd bowl I caught myself hunched over my bong. I had been there for minutes, blankly staring at my computer screen. There was a girl looking at me through the monitor, her face a complex assembly of geometry. My minds eye was becoming increasingly dominant. My thoughts weren't no longer limited to language, all had images and sounds and other sensory information to accompany them.\n\n\"What happened to the music?\" Ashley asked. She was right, it had stopped. I stared at the screen. I didn't want to get up, but I needed music. \"Fine, I'll do it\" she said when I didn't move. I wondered what she meant. Then I felt my body sit up and lean forward towards the computer. My arms reached for and moved the mouse. Yet, I was not the one controlling these actions, she was. I felt her reaching through me to move my limbs. Never before had she simply taken control from me.\n\nSomeone pinged my name in IRC. They asked how I was doing. It took me 10 minutes to figure out how to just how to respond. I didn't want to distract myself from the experience, so I didn't try to talk for long.\n\nI tried a little bit of imposition, knowing that soon I would not have the presence of mind to do so. I focused on Ashley. My vision began to gray around the edges. Internal visualization began to override external sight. All within the span of less than a minute I felt sucked into my visualization of her. We were standing face to face in the middle of a street I didn't recognize. I had never clearly seen her form visually for more than a split second. Here, her form was stable and completely lifelike. I was ecstatic. The hallucination didn't last, I felt it fade away as I returned to reality.\n\nOne bowl later I stopped smoking for awhile, simple because it was distracting. I didn't need more anyways. Deep space was approaching rapidly. I was already deep in ego loss by that point. I didn't feel like Kaylee. I rationalized we were too different for us to truly be the same person. I decided I was a different Kaylee. Where did I come from? And what happened to her? The universe must have brought me into existence to experience the trip. Old Kaylee was gone. to return after the comedown.\n\nI remembered an artist I wanted to listen to. I had never listened to Shpongle while tripping, but I hadn't been terribly impressed sober. Yet it was the perfect, intricate and mood setting soundtrack for my trip."

        "description": "The visuals started to completely override my vision as I stared up towards the ceiling. Rather, I stared at sea of flowing color and geometry that stretched on infinitely. Over the next few hours I was almost completely removed from reality. Even after I would briefly return it took mere seconds for the visuals to overwhelm my vision and send me off again. Minutes felt like lifetimes. My eyes fluttered and moved rapidly. It felt like rapid eye movement from dreaming. By this point, whether my eyes were open or closed, I was hallucinating. With the rapid eye movement, they would often stay half open. The body high was all-encompassing pleasure. Sheer bliss poured into every single nerve. My back was arched, my toes curled like an orgasm. But the pleasure wasn't sexual, and it didn't subside.\n\nI lived moments from other peoples lives. I found myself in places I recognized from my dreams. Many I had completely forgotten about until I revisited them. I saw the first place I built in mindscape, and many other places Ashley and I had visited before.\n\nA brief lull in the intensity left me thinking introspectively. I thought about the new apartment I couldn't wait to move in to soon. One night I should invite my coworkers over I thought. Or anyone who wanted to come. I could invite the world. I forgave myself for many things I never could. I had always felt a tad guilty about how my pot and psychedelic use. I found myself wondering why I felt guilty for things that made me happy. I chose to let go of that weight, chose to free myself of the bias and ignorance my family and society had force fed me about drugs. The burden of guilt was lifted. I forgave myself for everything. Complete self-acceptance and inner peace is one of the best feelings I've ever experienced in my life.\n\nThroughout the trip I felt my ego completely die many times. It would start with a physical sensation, a tingling pleasure that would rise through my body. Different music would change the accompanying physical sensation. I felt my soul lifted from my body, an invisible force entering through my chest and nostrils, gently lifting me up and away. Other times I felt it drain away, sinking out of my body like water through a drain. Still other times I would let go of my ego with an exhale, or the music would simply overwhelm it.\n\nMy inner dialogue would completely stop as I became one with the moment, one with everything in the universe. I wondered if the universe was simply another inner reality that I had convinced myself was real. That made me God. Or maybe I was just an inhabitant in the mind of some other entity, our universe it's mindscape. I became nothing, and everything. I was the music playing to nobody, the moment experiencing itself. I had forgotten that I had taken 4-aco, forgotten who I was and what was happening. It was so blissful that it didn't matter. The complete ego loss would come and go. For the better part of the trip I was in this state, falling in and out of complete ego death, lost in my internal hallucinations.\n\nAshley came and went freely. Sometimes she was sitting next to me, or joined me in my hallucinations. She spent a lot of time in mindscape, going through ego death and hallucinations herself. Honestly, the distinction between mindscape and reality felt borderline trivial. I could feel when she experienced ego death, a powerful sensation even secondhand. Sometimes it would trigger ego death in me, other times I tried to share my love and joy with her in those moments. I had forgotten all concept of tulpas, she was just a friend who was with me.\n\nWe talked through images and emotion when language broke down. I would check in with her every so often if I had slipped away for awhile. At the highest peaks of trip, she would talk and I simply listened, incapable of more. Her voice was immensely comforting. Even when I would hit total ego death, sometimes her voice would break through the silence.\"Just let go, let it happen.\" , \"You are okay, breathe\" , \"Isn't it beautiful?\" are among what I remember her saying.\n\nA few times, she took control to change the music for me. A couple times I wasn't even be aware of her actions, so lost in internal reality, until the new song started playing.\n\nWhen the peak started to subside I thought of my close friend josikins who introduced me to psychedelics. I was joyous knowing that I wasn't alone in experiencing ego death, unity, etc. It was an extraordinary bond to share with someone.\n\nI thought about the billions of people who would never get to, or would never let themselves experience what I had, and pitied them.\n\nSeveral hours into the trip Ashley surprised me. She had been gone for a little while. She suddenly came back and grabbed my attention. I was initially shocked. She had changed her form. Not radically, she still looked like the same person, but the change was substantial. It wasn't a complete suprise, she had mentioned wanting to change her form. She looked a couple years younger, her hairstyle and clothes were different. One of the biggest surprises was how easily I could visualize her new form. I could visualize it instantly and perfectly from the start, matching or surpassing my visualization of her other form. After the trip, this has still remained true. We attribute this to her new form being a better reflection of herself."

        "description": "Coming down on 4aco is always tricky for me. Once I've come down enough I always start to feel melancholy about returning to the world. I listened to gentle and calming music and smoked more weed. Even still I was uneasy. At this point it was late in the night, around 12 AM. I was still tripping, but I was also getting tired. There was no way I was getting to sleep until I came down. I let my mind drift, the visuals greatly diminished, but my internal visualization was still remarkably vivid. Ashley comforted me to help me cope with coming down. Eventually I fell asleep watching TV with my friend. My sleep was restless, I woke up frequently in the night, in a state almost between sleep and waking. I would wake up for a few minutes, drift back into vivid dreams, then wake up again.\n\nThe overall trip felt longer than 4-aco by itself. Especially the length of the peak, which went strong for hours upon hours, most of the trip even. The syrian rue gives it a dreamlike quality, and greatly enhanced the sense of unity I felt during the trip. I will definitely be repeating the combination in the future, probably at the same dose, which felt just about right for me."

As high as the dose was, I suspected that, good or bad, it would be quite the adventure. As 5PM crept around that day, I prepared my dose, 60mg 4-aco-dmt and 3g syrian rue.

(When I usually trip, the peak happens exactly at three hours. I thought this trip was going to be the same, so I think this is why I freaked out.) I blasted off into hyperspace and it scared the absolute shit out of me. I tried as hard as I could to go with the flow and allow the shroom aliens to do what they wished with my brain chemicals in hyperspace, but I couldn’t stop being so terrified.\n\nIt was so fucking overwhelming. I thought about taking my benzos about a hundred times. I wanted to go back to being human, but I knew that I would regret it if I did, so I didn’t. At some points, the shroom aliens were doing strange things to my brain chemicals and showing me things in hyperspace. At other points, I was trying to die in the desert so I wouldn’t be a scared human being in hyperspace anymore. I remember trying to die in the desert and thinking “how long do I have to keep dying for?” I tried to die at least a hundred times (only a couple times were in the desert). It really felt like I was dying.\n\nThe entire trip was me trying to let go. I begged and prayed to the shroom gods to allow me to die so I could explore hyperspace without my scared human ego, but it never happened. Or at least I don’t think it did. I should have smoked weed – I think that would have gotten me there, but I was completely overwhelmed, so much that I couldn’t stand up.\n\nTime was moving incredibly slowly the entire time. I kept looking at the time and stopwatch on my phone, wondering when things would start making sense. It felt like all I had left of the human world was my ego and the time. I knew that I would return from hyperspace at the three hour mark and I was just counting down the seconds. I was also begging for the shroom aliens to just kill me and do whatever they wanted to me. I surrendered completely to them hundreds of times, but the terror just would not leave me. I was completely terrified, but I still managed to keep my mind together for the most part, and I knew the entire time that I could end it with a benzo."

    "introduction": "In the two years that I have been using psychedelics, I have had more than thirty individual experiences. I have used psilocybin mushrooms, 4-AcO-DMT, and MXE numerous times. I have also done DMT once, LSD twice, LSA once, 2C-E once, DXM several times, and MDMA three times. I am a daily cannabis smoker, but I had not had any previous experience with the drug 2C-B.\n\nTo prepare for the trip, Josikins read MAPS' manual for [MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for the Treatment of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder](https://maps.org/research-archive/mdma/MDMA-Assisted-Psychotherapy-Treatment-Manual-Version7-19Aug15-FINAL.pdf).\n\nThe purpose of this trip was to reduce my current Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms from a sexual assault that occurred a year ago. My plan for the day was to take 150 mg of MDMA and then dose 20 mg of 2C-B as I felt myself come down from the first drug. I had eaten very little the previous day and did not eat at all the day of the trip. I was not taking any supplements or medications in the days prior to the experience except for cannabis. I tested the chemicals using a test kit and they were confirmed to be MDMA and 2C-B. I weighed out the 150 mg of MDMA and 20 mg of 2C-B using a milligram scale that may or may not be off by 5 mg.",

My day started off with a panic attack. At 3:00pm (T+0:00), my girlfriend encouraged me to insufflate 20mg of MDMA to ease myself into the drug slowly and calm myself down. The insufflated dose relaxed me in only ten minutes and at T+0:25 I took 130mg of MDMA orally in a capsule.\n\nI was hit by a sudden wave of nausea at T+1:00. I smoked hash oil in an attempt to ease my stomach, but vomited minutes later. After vomiting, I remarked that I felt both strange and pleasant at the same time and that it felt like the MDMA had, at that moment, flipped a switch in my brain. I enjoyed the empathogenic properties of increased empathy and sociability. The drug allowed me to communicate effortlessly with my girlfriend without becoming defensive or insecure. I felt more empathetic towards other people and behaved more generously.\n\nIn terms of visual enhancement, I experienced an increase in the clearness of my vision (visual acuity) and noticed that colors appeared more vibrant and intense than before (enhancement of color perception). In terms of visual distortions, I hallucinated visual drifting (breathing) as well as the symmetrical texture repetition of random imagery, geometry, and patterns on my apartment walls. Upon closing my eyes, I hallucinated partially defined geometry (which was unimpressive). I had never had more control over my eyeballs and could not stop wiggling them around in strange, rapid patterns.\n\nAnother wave of nausea hit me at T+1:30. After dry heaving for five minutes, I smoked a dab of hash oil. I started to have a panic attack ten minutes afterwards. Josie guided me through a breathing meditation exercise which calmed me down significantly. The sharp increase in pre-existing tactile sensations took breathing to a whole new level. At T+2:50, I noticed that smoking menthol cigarettes and stretching my muscles were incredibly pleasurable. As I smoked, I was able to experience conceptual thinking about the cigarette in my hand.\n\nAt T+3:00, I asked Josikins to continue guiding me through breathing meditation. The exercise brought me euphoria and I felt as though I could meditate forever without losing attention. After meditating for thirty minutes, I heard a commanding voice from my subconscious tell me to *“take 2c-b now.”* Upon feeling anxiety at this request, the head voice reassured me that I still had a good time window to take the drug and that everything would be okay. I discontinued the breathing meditation and weighed out my dose of 2C-B."

In terms of external hallucinations, I saw psychedelic mushrooms on my girlfriend’s shirt, giving me the impression that she was a shaman helping me on my spiritual journey. My feelings of profoundness for the universe got more and more intense as the meditation continued.\n\nI experienced a change in perspective in which it seemed incredibly obvious to me that everything in the universe could be defined as the opposition or contrast between each other. After this feeling of duality, I feared that if I went any further into myself I would die and may never come back. Deciding that I didn’t want to die, I asked my girlfriend to stop meditation. I told her that I was exhausted and was “going fucking deep.”\n\nAfter feeling a bit lost around T+1:30, I asked Josikins for some ideas on what to do during the trip. she suggested that I could snort more MDMA, listen to music, or discuss the event which triggered my Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. After requesting cosmic music, my girlfriend linked me to a YouTube link of the Galaxy Song video from the movie Monty Python located at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buqtdpuZxvk\n\nDepth perception distortions manifested themselves while I watched the music video. In my vision, objects and actors in the music video that were in the background appeared in the foreground and vice versa. The layers in the music video were mixed up in organization, giving me the sensation that I was, too, in the music video. Cognitively, feelings of unity between myself and specific external systems arose. I experienced a loss of perceived boundaries between my sense of self and Josikins, the actors and directors of Monty Python, and the people responsible for uploading the music video onto YouTube. I felt like I had planned the lives of all of these people just for this particular moment. I felt as though the man singing in the video was singing to me specifically and I was completely immersed. On some deep level, I knew that the singer was both Josikins and myself. It was as though I had lived the lives of the actors in previous lives. When the universe takes the form of a pregnant lady and gives birth, I felt as though I had raped myself in order to create the universe as we know it. I was the creator of the universe.\n\nAfter the video ended, I requested another video. My girlfriend linked me to the music video for the song What Fills the Gap by Will Cady featuring Alan Watts located at youtube\n\nI was, once again, fully immersed inside the music video. As my screen showed a still-frame of the Earth in its entirety, I felt one with it. The video then switched to images of the microscopic level (bacteria, cells, etc) which resulted in conceptual thinking and feeling of profoundness for the complexity of our universe—both inner and outer. My sense of self became attributed to everything in the music video including Earth, bacteria, cells, humans, monkeys, a crowd of people, the actors in the film, the people responsible for the development of the airplane, and the men flying the airplanes in the video. When the music video showed scenes of destruction, I felt personally responsible for it. I watched airplanes and houses explode alongside the lyrics “time will pass and reduce to ash your bones.” I felt as though I was responsible for the atomic bombs and had killed (as well as died) millions of times. This moment seemed beyond perfect.\n\nIn the music video, I heard Alan Watts say, *“We haven’t realized that life and death, black and white, good and evil, being and non-being come from the same sentience. They imply each other. What you are basically, deep deep down, far far in, is simply the fabric and structure of existence itself.”*\n\nThis reminder of duality pushed me into a state of level four unity in which, due to a loss of perceived boundaries, I became the entire universe within my internally stored model of reality (state of unity between the self and all external systems). I felt that I was, without a doubt, the universe experiencing itself through itself. I felt as though I had designed the universe with this one moment in mind. The contrast of the young, energetic couples dancing in the music video alongside the lyrics “time will pass and reduce to ash our bones” was too much for me. The men and woman were so full of life in the video, but I knew that they would all die eventually if they hadn’t already. I reached a state of level 5 unity where I became all of existence.\n\nI heard Alan Watt’s voice saying from my laptop, *”There’s no point in just sustaining bliss. Let's suppose that you were able every night to dream any dream you wanted to dream and that you could, for example, have the power within one night to dream 75 years of time. And you would, naturally, as you began on this adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes. You would have every kind of pleasure you could conceive.”*\n\nDepth perception distortions (similar to the Monty Python video) manifested themselves again as I continued watching the video. In my mind’s eye, I imagined myself living past lives while sustaining long-term bliss. Specifically, I remember imagining my life as an Egyptian ruler sunbathing. In this imaginary life, I had all the gold in the world and had fulfilled all of my desires, yet still felt as though something was missing. Eternal bliss did not go the way I had planned and thus I realized that long-term bliss was impossible and was not what I desired in the long run. By trying to live a life of pleasure with an absence of pain, I was essentially trying to have white without black. Long term pleasure was not ultimately satisfying in a way that a mixture of both pleasure and pain could be.\n\nI came to the realization that I would not change anything in the universe even if I had the power to. I felt as if the universe was already perfect in its present time—both the good and the bad. I had designed it this way myself and to god, there was no difference between the two sides of the coin. Pain or pleasure, good or evil, yin and yang were the same to me and only differed in their contrast to each other. I realized that I could not have a game where everyone wins. I applied yin and yang to all situations in the universe.\n\nAlan Watts continued, “And after several nights, of 75 years of total pleasure each, you would say ‘now let's have a surprise… let's have a dream which isn't under control… You would get more and more adventurous, and you would make further and further out gambles as to what you would dream.”\n\nI went into a seemingly timeless cognitive delusion where I was the creator of everything that ever was, ever has been, and ever could be. I was, without a doubt, the all-powerful god and could cause life to exist with my imagination. After I imagined myself into existence multiple lives of eternal bliss, I got more adventurous. I imagined into existence more ridiculous scenarios of how far I could go from god. I gained an immense amount of satisfaction by tricking myself into believing that I was not god. I loved making myself worship myself, argue about myself, live for myself, and kill for myself. I did this repeatedly because the moment that I became god got so much funnier the deeper from god I went. I imagined billions of universes into existence and every single one of them was exactly how I wanted it to be—the perfect mixture of pain, pleasure, and humor. I made it all into a cosmic joke.\n\nAs the creator of this cosmic joke, my jokes were both sadistic and masochistic in nature. I was responsible for billions of years of pain, horror, and destruction. I used them as plot devices for my jokes. These concepts had no emotional attachment at the time due to my strong feelings of duality. I tortured myself billions of times for the sake of a laugh. I wanted to experience all there was to experience—even pain. I created existences for myself in which I suffered from deliberating mental disorders and mental retardation. I knew that nothing could ultimately hurt me in the end. I had no choice but to use pain and pleasure equally. It was as if all of existence could be divided into two equal parts—the yin and the yang, the good and the evil, pain and pleasure, everything and nothing, life and death. I made all of my universes with this duality in mind. I warped the yin and yang into as many ways possible, but I made it satisfying and humorous too. I plotted my universes to the smallest detail on the cellular level.\n\nIt was a cosmic game at best, but a game worth playing to the ends of infinity, no matter how terrible it appeared to get. I had designed it this way myself in advance and was not afraid to live all of its existence. I had made it absolutely perfect for myself.\n\nAlan Watts continues, *“And finally you would dream where you are now.”*\n\nSuddenly I imagined myself into my current life as a twenty year old human. At this point I felt the sensation that I had literally tripped myself sober. I had tripped so goddamn hard that I had looped around and gone full circle into sobriety. It felt like god had taken a psychedelic drug and became a twenty year old human instead of the other way around. After the video ended, I regained my long-term memory, though my short-term memory remained noticeably impaired. Still in a state of level 5 unity, I resumed conversation with Josikins. I expressed difficulty with communicating what I had just experienced, so I simply remarked that “2c-b is a great therapy drug” and thanked her for helping me through this."

        "description": "After smoking hash oil at T+2:04, my short-term memory disintegrated to insane levels. Josikins told me my options once again and this time I tried to process my sexual assault. After experiencing difficulty, Josikins tried repeating the phrase “the nature of the incident does not affect your value as a human being and depending on your own perspective you can allow it to make you stronger if you choose to” for three minutes. At first I questioned the phrase, but was able to answer the questions as I went deeper and deeper inside of myself.\n\nFinally the only question left unanswered was *“how do I allow it to make me stronger?”* By T+2:20, my short-term memory was extremely impaired to the point where I forgot what I was doing. Josikins reminded me that I was attempting to process my rape. I remarked that it was too big to process and my girlfriend replied that “you only perceive it as big because you choose to do so.” I started feeling anxious about whether my girlfriend would leave me at this moment.\n\nBy T+2:30, my short-term memory was fucked up to the point where I would start saying a statement and then forget what I was saying halfway through. Eventually I remembered that I was processing my sexual assault and Josikins repeated the phrase *“I was raped and this is okay”* for seven minutes. I questioned the mantra and eventually accepted it. I came to the realization that although I had a negative attachment to the traumatic event, it was in contrast to a state of positivity and part of a bigger, harmonious system.\n\nUpon declaring the need for a new mantra at T+2:40, Josikins came up with the phrase *“I designed it this way myself.”* As she repeated this for a total of twenty minutes, my feelings of profoundness for the universe grew more intense. Audible hallucinations manifested themselves after ten minutes of the mantra. I hallucinated my girlfriend alternately repeat two statements instead of one, hearing *“I designed it this way myself” as well as “I designed it to slay myself.”*\n\nA couple minutes after this, the phrase turned into six different phrases. I hallucinated hearing *“I designed it this way myself. I designed it to slay myself. I designed it to persuade myself. I designed it to weigh myself. I designed it to dismay myself. I designed it to save myself”* repeatedly. I was euphoric that the single phrase had been able to change into so many other true phrases.\n\nThese six sentences kept repeating until finally the mantra stopped making sense completely. My feelings of duality got more apparent until all I could comprehend in the mantra were the words “I” and “myself.” With this, I realized that I was all there was and ever would be. I went into a cognitive delusion in which I became the creator of everything that I could imagine in all time frames of existence. I created universes that are completely ineffable to me when sober. By pure thought alone, I was able to imagine into existence highly complex alien societies and universes. I felt one with all of imagined existence including the alien, the ineffable, and the human. There was nothing that was not me.\n\nRape, death, pain, and destruction were nothing to me at that moment and I used them as plot devices in this cosmic joke of mine. My joke was absolutely perfect in every single way. I had designed it this way myself to slay, persuade, weigh, dismay, and save myself. The feeling of becoming god from something so much simpler was the ultimate high. I had tricked myself and I loved it. I had acted so goddamn convincing as a twenty year old human. I felt as though I was in the fabric of existence and the moment could not have felt more perfect."

        "description": "I came back into reality at T+3:00 and resumed casual conversation with my girlfriend. I got some water and food after noticing that I was hungry and had a headache. I tried to eat processed food, but it turned into a sticky goop inside my mouth which then turned into abstract representations of molecular structures before I was even able to swallow. I was not satisfied with it at all and could not take another bite. The food tasted like foam and all I desired was fruit.\n\nWhile coming down from the 2C-B, I talked to Josikins about my trip and various topics. For the next few hours, the cognitive effects of connectivity of thought and level 4 unity remained. Time seemed to move slowly. I smoked more hash oil and watched Sympathy of Science’s Brain music video located at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB7jSFeVz1U\n\nI also repeatedly rewatched the previous two music videos. Josikins left at 1:30am. I continued to watch the music videos and smoke hash oil until I felt like I could sleep.\n\nWhen I awoke I was greeted with feelings of rejuvenation and sustained unity. Although I still have symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, I feel as though they have been greatly reduced thanks to my trip. My anxiety levels have gone down and I finally feel like I am processing my sexual assault instead of living in the past. Overall, I found the combination of MDMA and 2C-B to be extremely helpful for therapeutic purposes."

The significance of everything was greatly increased and the epiphany that I was killing millions of insects and bacterium with every foot step staggered me with its importance. I began to dissociate from myself, as a human, and think of the world as a whole. I identified with those insects and bacterium and felt sorrow and guilt for killing them. This feeling reminded me of Jainism, and I pondered on humanity's relationship to the environment for the rest of the lecture. Throughout all of this, I was mentally present and focused. The stimulation and motivation was clean and focused on what I was learning, and I took great joy in the process of learning itself."

Around 45 minutes later I started feeling the effects of the MDMA, which are quite familiar to me. It must have been 10-15 minutes before I started to feel the effects of the MDA, which I had never taken before. At this point I took another 100mg of each, because I thought that my tolerance was the reason that the effects were so mild. So by my estimate it was an hour and a half to two hours before the MDA kicked in, and it hit me like a freight train.\n\nOne minute I was talking about how I didn't really feel anything more than the mild rolling feeling, and then I got up from laying on the floor to get a drink and WHAM."

For about 30 minutes to an hour I was overwhelmed with an erotic sort of intensity that made me not want to move for a good twenty minutes. The visuals were nice, but they were relatively mild, and typical of psychedelics but not really the focus of the trip, so I won't say anymore about the visuals.\n\nThe next few hours were filled with wonder and amazement at all things. There was a confidence and optimism that I find hard to reach while sober.\n\nThe strangest of all of the effects to me was the auditory distortion. I'm a musician, and this is the first time I've had any kind of auditory hallucination, so it was a sort of mind-blowing experience to hear a noticeable difference in all of the sounds I was experiencing.\n\nThe way I noticed was I put on one of my favorite albums, Cake's Fashion Nugget. It seemed at the time that the sound distortion was only obvious on familiar songs with vocal parts.\n\nI didn't notice a difference while listening to Beethoven's 9th and instrumental parts of other songs were hard to differentiate, but voices stuck out as being distinctly slowed down. This was not limited to recorded music, but my voice and my girlfriend also sounded lower than normal.\n\nA month or two later I tried another dose of MDA (100mg) with the intention of paying special attention to the auditory aspect of the experience since it had been such an interesting effect the first time, but this dose didn't seem to produce the same pronounced effects. I tried again at the 200mg level, and sure enough all sounds I heard were deeper, the ringtone of my phone, my voice, and the familiar sound of a local DJ's voice were all noticeably lower, though the effects were less profound this time.\n\nMentally I would have to say that the empathy factor was lower than with MDMA, but since I took both and my tolerance was not at base level, I don't really think it's fair for me to judge that.\n\n(Revision: now that I've tried MDA alone I would say that the empathetic feelings that are a hallmark of MDMA are not even worth mentioning. I don't feel like MDA would be as useful for interpersonal therapy, though it could still be useful in deprogramming past traumas)\n\nMy last MDA dose was 200mg, and I felt that it was too much for me to really enjoy. I spent a good portion of the trip trying to get comfortable, but no matter what, I could not find a position or spot that I could be content with for more than a few minutes.\n\nAnother very present effect was a GREAT reduction in my short term memory. I would be talking with my girlfriend and I would either forget what she was talking about or forget what I was talking about in the middle of a sentence. This could be due to my higher doses.\n\nThis was not at all conducive to conversation, but I feel that it would be very useful for meditation."

I’m only tripping lightly but I’m honestly much more impressed with this substance than I thought I would be. It feels easy on the body, it’s not disorientating, and unlike 4-HO-MET the visual effects seem to actually have depth to them.\n\nI was initially playing retro videogames with my flatmate while cuddling and I realised that I wasn’t experiencing any deep or introspective thoughts. I decided I would try and watch episode 5 of the midnight gospel as I vaguely remembered it having a lot of deep Buddhist themes. As soon as I put it on I am absolutely blown away by how it looks and am almost overwhelmed at points throughout the episode. It left me confused and deeply contemplating a lot of the Buddhist content I have been reading recently.\n\nLater on I started cooking with my roommate. While whisking an egg I found myself visualising the history of cooking, ancient man, the development of agriculture, and the amount of technology that went into the fork I was holding, the bowl I was whisking the egg in, and the various kitchen appliances I could see around me. These are not things I would even consider for a second if I was sober, or at least not while cooking.\n\nWhen I close my eyes I see LSD like geometry. They aren’t super intense and are at about level 3. However, I can clearly see that they have potential if I were to take a higher dose. I have also been experiencing acuity enhancement, colour enhancement, and level 2 drifting that is exclusively within my peripheral vision."

My friend and I played video games most of the time, starting with Tetris Attack on the SNES while we waited for the drug to come up.\n\nThis drug was very similar to shrooms and LSD. It first started adopting shroom-like qualities and at the peak turned more into an LSD feeling. I was genuinely surprised with how good the body high felt. I never once felt too uncomfortable, minus a few times where I was getting too warm or too cold. We specifically took a threshold dose the first time to dip our toes in, but we plan on revisiting this drug in the coming weeks at progressively higher doses. I greatly enjoyed the entire experience at this level and can recommend it to anyone that wants a trip similar to shrooms or LSD but doesn't want to commit more than 4-5 hours to it.",

It made all my problems wash away, you could say that I dissociated from them… I was heartbroken as hell, but that suddenly became a passing feeling, an irrelevancy to the wide world of MXE. I was moving apartments, and my entire room was empty except for an air mattress and a lamp and a suitcase. It felt like a new start. Of course drugs never work that way for me. I was crushingly depressed pretty soon after I came down, but it was nice, it was really nice. I have been doing and raving about MXE for some time now. Unfortunately MXE went extinct, but here’s an artifact of its existence, a report on MXE alone (at last!)",

My sense of proprioception is gone, with my eyes closed I cannot even tell which hand is left or right. My head feels very heavy, and it feels like I have a tight hat or headband wrapped around my head.\n\nI begin to think about people with my eyes closed, I see the silhouettes of those who come into my mind, their colorful essences rising from their body like a smoky aura. Memory begins to become an absurd concept, it feels like I am feeling all of my thoughts and feelings at once, that they are laid out before me for me to sort through. New ones do not form sequentially but merely arise in this grand mess, memory in terms of some sort of chronology suddenly fades to nothing."

I am almost entire anesthetized, the anesthesia feels like fingers gripping and wrapping around me, crawling onto and clutching my face. The closed eye visuals continue to become intense, one visual was a fractalized hand, with a hand on the end of each fingers, repeating into infinity. They vary between being concrete and abstract, another was a red and maroon rushing hyperspace tunnel, a big droopy web in the center of my field of vision. I can feel a bitter cold fire raging in my core. With my eyes open. Everything is shrouded in maroon and green auras. Objects warp and drift and bubble at their edges.\n\nI close my eyes again and it definitely feels like I am in a hole. The MXE hole is characterized by shifting through all variety of places and experiences, it’s like on grand adventure in my head, it’s like inducing dream, with a numbing feeling to my body, a semi-lucid dream spawned from my aesthetic pleasures. My entire existence reduced to a six pointed star, It feels like my body has turned to putty and is being stretched and pulled and rolled in various ways. Or like I am a slick of oil on the surface of a rushing and warbling river. Or it feels like I am just stuck to the blade of a perpetually spinning fan. Or that I am on a train. One of the most common and pleasant is the feeling of being encased in a chamber, and them flying through outer space, it is this essence of flying, my body’s sense of balance and position adjusted accordingly. My entire frame of existence is being shaken and stirred.\n\nAlmost all these feelings involve a sense of being weightless or underwater, and this persistent feeling of being sprayed in the face with a hose, but it’s a very warm and numbing stream. I also feel like I am buzzing and vibrating the entire time. At another point I find myself floating in a body of water, towering structures around me, made of interlocking green tendrils under a pulsing blue sun in a black sky. I think about friendship, and how wonderful friends are, and am filled with this glowing warmth and desire for overwhelming platonic relationships. Hm. I feel like I am being deposited like sediment in a turbulent river. It feels like I am being encased in a great warping metal. I have begun to tap into my dream memories, a recurring occurrence with dissociatives. The closed eye space has been primarily taken over by these green tendrils forming into fantastic creatures, sometimes to my will."

I drift around this immense void, with great pulsing radiating disembodied buildings floating around me like in the very final scene of Akira (excuse the reference but it was almost entirely analogous to that).\n\nHands are wrenching my essence from right angles and are pulling it apart, disintegrating me into obscurity. Opening my eyes is like popping up on the surface of the water after diving down for a long time- I find myself short of breath and very disoriented, briefly quite unaware of where I am or how I got there. With eyes open I have a slightly better sense of body, and everything is like tendrils. I feel like I am a big U shaped noodle. My legs are unctuous, they are like a strand of spaghetti or an oil slick floating atop an undulating sea, waving and rippling at the mercy of the waves. Strange red block figures, perhaps distant ambassadors from ‘the other’ manifest with my eyes closed, although they are blurry and indistinct, watching me unobtrusively from a distance. The sound of my computer fan becomes distorted into garbled mumbling voices, like an auditory pareidolia.\n\nMentally, I just feel a pure and neutral dissociation, like my mind has been literally shaken to the point of being invalid and nonfunctional. I can’t really think about anything no matter how hard I try, I am at the mercy of whatever stray thoughts choose to drift by, like being forced to stare at clouds drifting across in the sky. I am blank and content and blissfully disconnected from the world around me. My memories of the day prior trickle in and feel like fiction in my head, becoming indistinguishable from the memories of recent dreams I have had. My daily life suddenly seems alien and baffling."

I feel as though this is the symbol of the “other”, perhaps not the “other” that I typically encounter, but a different “other”, one unique to this substance, one that holds reverence for straight lines, for linear vibrations, and for concentric pulses of force. I feel that I have entered a special and exclusive hole that few get to access, and that I have passed their test, that I am being recruited into their cadre.\n\nI get a vision of being a serpentine creature with bird head, constructed from harsh angles and straight lines, I am in an area or amphitheater, similarly devoid of any curves or circles.

My thoughts are scrambled and incoherent, evidenced by several notes I had taken at this point that make absolutely no sense to me. Time seems to be passing slowly, it feels as though time itself has coagulated and become gelatinous.\n\nIt’s very hard to move, but I don’t want to anyway. I feel extremely comfortable, as if my perception of physical self is pouring back into me and settling into the ideal position for maximum pleasure. I find myself constantly short of breath. My thoughts are so scattered and disconnected that I feel like an alien, that the contact with the other has seared my brain temporarily and that it is still trying to sort things out and reassemble itself in some way that will function in our world.\n\nI would definitely say I am out of the hole at this point.

Perhaps it’s the addition of cannabis, or my setting, but overall it provides an exciting and interesting experience that almost feels like an abraded and dulled down psychedelic, devoid of color and with a mysterious damper taking hold of my thoughts and moving them uncontrollably along some predetermined track. Overall it is very buzzy and vibrate-y. ",

        "description": "I’ve been walking for some time now. The whole street has a festive atmosphere with people blaring music out of amplifiers on the sidewalks and hanging out in the street in throngs, though this is a festival stricken by a severe opioid crisis and many of the people were seeking, dispensing, or administering their various highs. Police in mobile guard stands stood watch over the open market only to interfere if violence broke out. People twisted and faded in and out around me, circling into my sphere of existence as their voices flung and danced around me, shouts and mutters, some of them smoky and scraped and scarred, others booming and melodious. The sun is shining and beating down and people appear to be in good spirits, the energy coalescing into discrete blocks that drift around me as I walk. No one pays me any attention which is good because I do not know how well I would be able to interact with anyone right now. I feel strange and anxious and sweaty, but I don’t feel the anxiety in my gut. There is still no nausea or bodyload to note, the trip is well contained within my central nervous system. I feel giddy and jubilant like I am sailing with a strong headwind. Energy wells up inside of me, it’s a nice loose stimulation though and doesn’t bear the wound up tension that many other drugs can bring. Auditory effects are negligible beyond a more acute awareness of the space and direction of sounds, and an amplified sort of doppler effect as I move path stationary noises.\n\nThe visuals have set in more and more, they are mostly transparent overlays on everything else and are reminiscent of Mesoamerican glyphs, with intricate and well defined tangled forms, sinuous like serpents, with fronds and feathers blossoming at their apices. They carry a greenish tint but fade fairly easily into the environment."

I feel like I can only think about happy things, that even the grim things I can think about are still touched with happiness and pleasantry. It feels like it’s a façade, it feels like happiness misplaced, naïve and wrong, though not as intensely or artificially as with empathogens. It is still the deep, profound euphoria that comes from psychedelics, but it feels odd and out of place. I don’t get that sense of wanting to proclaim my newfound pleasure or revel in it, rather is sits there matter of fact, like a bird watching me from a tree. Also odd and out of place is the continuing lack of nausea or any kind of bodyload. The streets become less crowded the further I walk and find myself becoming more absorbed in gazing at things, textured surfaces, the sky, tree branches, etc.\n\nThe visuals dance around as bas-reliefs on mottled surfaces, still reminiscent of flowers and serpents. My thoughts are racing, tearing their way through my baseline of apprehension and turning themselves towards the sun so they can bask in its light. It’s such a beautiful day and it feels as though there will be a beautiful tomorrow too."

There is a subtle derealization carried with the sublime sense of aesthetics. Patterns weave their way out of the stone and drizzle from the sky, still writhing and entangling, still immaculately textured.

None of the pangs of nausea or tension of visceral anxiety, none of that twisting discomfort that always rocks the comeups of my trips. I didn’t think it was possible. Otherwise this trip is pleasant, bubbly, and optimistic in the way a child is on a sunny day. Mostly in the realm of the cognitive, with the visuals being slight and lacking in vibrant colors, with a fairly generic tryptamine overlay of the flowing blossoming organic crossed with the sharp lines of the synthetic. It is a short sweet and light experience that might be a candidate for a good easy starter psychedelic for the curious but uninitiated. Not necessarily shallow, but also not with enough depth to cause panic or resounding problems. I would definitely be interested in exploring higher doses of this substance to see whether the manageable pleasantry of this substance eventually caps off and disintegrates.",

A psychedelic fog envelops the world, bending around me like a gravity well, its residual energy pulsing through my body and overtaking me. I float and flit through a fluid world bathed in intricate interlocking patterns of warm colors, trying to avoid the glances of strangers and hoping loss prevention doesn’t notice how anxious I look. I am sweating profusely but the doors are in sight. I burst out into the city like a bullet exploding from the barrel of a gun, into the shock of the cold grey windy November air, biting and dense with the odor of the city."

It was a sense of a busy world swirling around me, bouncing on frantic gusts of wind that battered off my warm glowing core. There is a low rumbling sound burgeoning in the back of my head as I march onwards, and the ambient sounds of the city around me ripple and bubble in my skull.  I slip in and out of crowds of people and waited patiently for traffic, praying no one would look too closely at me, see how sweaty I was, see my wild eyes, see my teetering off balance, sense my pounding heart. I wasn’t particularly anxious but there was a sense of urgency to return to the safety of my home and panic as the experience grew more and more within me. In motion the trip felt suppressed by my physical activity and sense of objective- however every time I stopped, it felt like it descended on me, crashing over me like a flash flood I had been slowly outrunning. Each time I stopped it came back stronger and stronger, and by the time I had arrived at home it had all but swallowed me into its twisting tessellated gullet. I had been overcome with its power and I was so glad to be somewhere warm and safe and familiar."

        "description": "As I walk up the stairs to my bedroom, the most notable effect becomes prominent- a sort of personification of all of the sounds around me- it is as if my brain is recognizing every bit of auditory stimulus as a sentient being. There is a sense of presence that people often carry, a chimera of their other senses that synthesizes into the idea of detecting another sentient being in their proximity. It feels as if my circuits have been scrambled and my sense of presence is being distinctly activated by my sense of sound. Each footstep is fluttery, jovial, laughing. The sound of my jacket rustling as I take it off is shifty and brooding, perched above me, gently watching. My sound of my backpack zipper is stretching and yawning and reclining in the aether. There is no other sensory detection of these sonic phantoms, just this distinct sense of presence and sentience. It is extremely weird.\n\nAside from that, this trip is extremely active and energetic- I feel like I am radiating heat and energy, and there is noticeable hyperthermia. Despite it being a cold day, I am content to sit in my room in just a t shirt. I want to curl into a ball and think and think and just emit fractal heat into the world around me, but I also want to zoom around my space as quickly as possible, bouncing off of the walls and vibrating the air to shreds. I am thinking about dogs a lot, about how their excitement and energy matches mine right now. I feel like a wild animal, frantic and high strung.\n\nThe visuals are kaleidoscopic, buzzing, stepped and zigzagged. They are dominated by warm colors and adorned with pulsing concentric patterns in stark contrasting colors. They too radiate heat and energy, baking and glowing like the coils of an electric stove. Every part of my existence is cooking with a splendid energy right now.\n\nThe trip itself feels active and alive and sentient- a trickster spirit lording over me, shocking me, glowering and grinning, it dances around me, casting me with ribbons of light and vibrating my hot hot bones to their core. There is just so much going on at once, it is not exactly overwhelming but is fairly mentally exhausting. But I still have the energy to enjoy it for now. I keep getting pangs of familiar feelings, hearkening back to my first ever experience with mushrooms, an overwhelmingly powerful trip that set the standard for the rest of my explorations. That was a terrifying and jarring experience by all measures and these little nostalgic flutters carry that same sense of anxiety.\n\nThe nausea is fairly standard for a tryptamine, though I find myself on the brink of throwing up several times. It is punctuated against a mild nauseous background. I almost threw up on the street several times walking home, but I can suppress it."

        "description": "I smoke some weed to try and soften the nauseous anxious edge. The visuals flare up and increase their velocity, and the steady burn of this trip crackles and flares. There is just so much going on that I really don’t feel like taking notes or stopping to think about it or type about it. So many visuals to see, so many strange sound-people to interpret, so much excitement, my mind is moving so fast! I feel like if I don’t fully immerse myself I am going to miss something interesting. I close my eyes and bake in the rays of the experience, I am greeted by a field of pulsing golden diamond fractals, rippling outwards into an oblivion, both infinite yet entirely encompassed by my nervous, darting vision.\n\nThe auditory-sentience effect is still extremely weird and I cannot even listen to music by virtue of it because it’s so uncomfortable. It feels fundamentally wrong. It is the same sense of phantom presences that other very high doses of psychedelics or deliriants have brought about in me, which is odd because otherwise I wouldn’t say I’m tripping extremely hard. These phantasms are very ephemeral, they don’t exist long enough to develop personalities or anything. They don’t necessarily feel alien either, but rather oddly familiar. It feels like an amalgamate glitch in my mental machinery, like assets from other aspects of my senses and mental processing have spawned in the wrong places."

        "description": "Everything has become extremely funny for me. This is an effect that usually occurs on the comeup of certain psychedelics, but it seems to be burning strong on the peak. Perhaps it has been here all along and simply made itself known as the anxiety slowly recedes. Nevertheless, I am cracking up at internet memes, I feel like I’m seeing so many layers into them (both visually and metaphorically). I am laughing uncontrollably at silly weird twitter tweets and at my own content, laughing until tears stroll down my face. I must look like I’m having a fit of hysterical madness. I cannot pry the smile off my face that impales into my cheeks making them sore. I don’t know if the experience is necessarily euphoric, it’s more that I am being barraged with beams of mad, unrestrained ecstasy, vibrating me into a tessellation upon impact. \n\nI am finding myself clinging to my space heater now as the hyperthermia has steadily slinked into the afternoon. I am curled up before it like a cat, laughing at my own thoughts as they wisp out into the rising warm air of the heater. I am content to languish here, big dumb smile on my face, nuzzling like an animal in its nest, under the watchful but tiring gaze of a million golden eyes locked in a warm incandescent fog. The same kaleidoscopic diamonds continue to radiate concentrically from me like pixelated ripples on the surface a metallic iridescent pond. I’m having so much fun doing absolutely nothing.\n"

I bask in the glow of my space heater as the inherent heat and energy of the experience recedes further. I hang out with my big Millipede, Shoes, and let him run around all over me and all over my bed. I have such a big dumb goofy smile on my face, I am happy thinking about him and the little world he lives in.\n\nAn empathogenic edge begins to bake into the trip, I just want to snuggle up in my soft covers with all of my sweet pets around me and think nice thoughts about pleasurable things. I feel glistening and glittery like I am riding a warm gust of wind carrying a million little flakes of mica or maybe iridescent butterfly scales. I am so happy thinking about my little critters, I am happy thinking about my friends and people I want to be around. All of this riding the coattails of still fairly intense visuals and a persistent off-kilter dissociation.\n\nThere is also this pervasive sense of this asymptotic approach to a maximized state of goodness and comfort- I just feel like I can always feel more comfortable, I can always feel better, and its hard to settle with what I have now, despite it being absolutely ecstatic. It eludes me like a neon dragonfly darting away from a net."

    "conclusion": "There is chatter about 4-PrO-DMT being a prodrug to 4-HO-DMT, similar to what is conjectured about 4-AcO-DMT. I will say this one experience differed a fair bit from most of my experiences with 4-HO-DMT or 4-AcO-DMT. (Though to be fair it has been several years since I’ve taken either). Most notable differences were its short duration, the degree of stimulation and hyperthermia, the jagged and angular high velocity visuals dominated by warm colors and bright contrasts, the empathogenic edge to it on the comedown, and particularly, the very strange audio-personification effect, the “Sonic Phantoms”. I hypothesize that whatever part of my brain typically recognized and registered human interaction and presence had gained some sort of associative pathway with my auditory senses. However, some sort of ancestral vestigial relationship to my experiences with mushrooms was felt- there was a powerful sense of clear nostalgia and déjà vu and simulation of sensations and thoughts and flashes from my most powerful mushroom experiences. It definitely felt related in some way. All that aside it is a warm and odd little psychedelic that delivers a fast and furious trip that dazzles the senses.",

There are rainbow auras around things and my entire field of vision seems to be pulsing and flowing around the edges. I sit on a rock to watch the sunset, but the bodyload is immense. I am very nauseous and I feel like I am about to throw up. The sunlight is all powerful and cascades around me, I truly feel like I am bathing in its heat and life. I try to catch insects here, but find them to be sparser than I thought they would be. This is slightly frustrating. I am manically pacing the area, the restlessness I feel is incredible and overpowering. I wish the nausea would go away. Other people come to hang out on the rock and smoke and I suddenly find myself extremely anxious. I feel as though the deep discomfort of this trip would very adversely affect my ability to interact with others and I am deeply afraid they might try to interact with me. I feel as though I would only be able to stammer out incoherencies. Sounds in the distance and reverberating and trailing off, and the clouds begin to morph into meso-american looking patterns.\n\n\nMy thoughts begin to travel to darker places, I begin thinking of the incredible amount of violence that has existed in the world, of what it must be like to sustain incredibly traumatic injuries, like being slashed with a sword, run through with a spear, shot with an arrow, shot with a gun, hit by shrapnel, stepping on landmines, stabbed with a knife, having limbs be dismembered or crushed or mangled. It pains me to know that so many people in the history of earth have felt these incredible and mind boggling pains, and I realize how fortunate I am that I do not live surrounded by war and violence. I imagine the horrors that battlefields of old must have been, with so many people having their entire lives snuffed out in a frenzy of incredible pain and physical trauma. I wonder how it must feel to bleed out on a battlefield after having a limb cut off with a blade, or blasted to shreds from a musket shot or gun shot. And then there’s the fact that some people dedicate themselves to a cause by means of violence, that someone has read up on the theory of a cause, that they have dreams of elevating that cause and bringing it to fruition, they have taken up arms and yet before they can make meaningful change they are blown to pieces by mortar fire or something. And even without violence one can be traumatically injured, it could happen to me today. I could get hit by a car, or fall off a cliff. I realize how precious and fragile my body is and vow to protect it as best I can."

It’s surreal to walk by that while I’m covered in dirt wearing torn up clothes. I reach a point where there is a lot of plant growth around the river and the sound of insects becomes deafening. I lie down and take it in. It amazes me that almost all insects are silent and rely on chemical signals and odors, but there are a few who have adapted to use sound to communicate. It amazes me how almost all sound generating insects belong to a specific order (Orthoptera), yet there are a few prominent examples in other orders (like cicadas), meaning that the ability to generate sound was a result convergent evolution. The buzzing vibrates and reverberates around my skull, it’s like listening to really buzzy noise music. It feels like it’s making my brain vibrate, and it’s really neat to pick out the sound of each individual species. I am getting devoured by mosquitos. I begin to think of all the insects flying around filled with my blood, It’s surreal to imagine little parcels of my blood flitting through the air. I see a bat above snatching up insects and my thoughts turn to violence again, the violence of nature. How an insect going about its business is suddenly accosted from the gloom by this horrific hairy creature with massive fangs. The pain an insect must feel when it gets crunched between those sharp teeth, the pain insects must feel from all of the unimaginably horrific ways they can die. And it’s weird to consider that a bat is eating little bits of my blood."

    "introduction": "A little more than three years ago, I was hanging out with some friends and the topic of Salvia came up. A couple of my friends, who were younger than me, had smoked it before. At the time I had been smoking cannabis regularly for two years and also had experiences with psilocybin mushrooms, dextromethorphan, and diphenhydramine. I knew that Salvia was much more intense than almost any other substance, but I had to see it for myself. One friend's (\"friend B\") description of his trip made me decide to buy some; he said every time he laughed, his head felt like it was made of pieces of Lego which were falling apart. This intrigued me.\n\nWe went to our local headshop and I purchased one gram of 20x Salvia Divinorum. It came in a plastic Ziploc bag with a sticker-label on it, and the stuff looked like crushed spider-legs. The girl behind the counter gave her mandatory spiel about using it in a safe environment, with a trip sitter, etc., but as you will read later we didn't exactly follow her instructions. After procuring the Salvia, the four of us headed to our friend's house nearby. We'll call him \"friend A\". Our biggest problem: Friend A's mother was an addictions counselor and wouldn't be pleased with us smoking dissociatives in her basement. Thankfully, via some sort of kismet she had plans to go see a movie, so we sat on the couch and packed a bowl of Salvia mixed with a bit of weed into a bong while we waited for her to leave.",

        "description": "Soon enough, we heard the front door open and her car pulled out of the driveway; we were good-to-go. since I'd paid for the Salvia I had dibs on the first bowl. I pulled slowly and deeply, making sure to burn the whole bowl. My friends stared with bated breath. I held the smoke in for about 5 seconds then exhaled, which elicited gasps of dismay from two friends.\n\n\"You're supposed to hold it in man, now it probably won't work\", they advised. However, within a few seconds, I could see things beginning to change; my friends' faces looked like some kind of blurry plasticine. I sunk into the couch and clutched its armrest with anticipation. They could see my expression changing quickly, and remarked that I was obviously starting to trip. I looked at the TV across the room and was shocked that I could see the entire TV. It was like I could see all six sides of the TV unfolded before me, including its wiry innards. My mouth gaped as I took all of this in.\n\nFriend C (A's sister) abruptly tried to grab a sweater I had been sitting on. When I felt the tug under me, I looked down. The space between the sweater and the couch was a void. A deep, black void that wanted to suck me in. I clutched the sweater into my arms and tried to stretch it back over the void. \"I need this!\" I hissed. She laughed awkwardly and remarked that she was cold, but didn't try to take the sweater.\n\nAnd then suddenly, I heard a familiar sound. Like the slamming of wood and metal, but I couldn't understand it. Then, from out of the six-dimensional TV, came a woman's voice. It shouted my Friend A's name and I saw my friends reel with terror. I realized that was not a hallucination; my friend's addiction-counsellor mom came home. \"Fuck! What's she doing home so early!?\" Friend A remarked. Then I stupidly decided to try to speak, \"But... she can't yet. I'm on the... the thing. Um. Salvia.\" I mumbled flatly. I heard the basement door open.\n\n\"Shut up! Don't say that word! Fuck, man!\" Friend B hissed. I tried to process this.\n\n\"But... I'm... Salvia.\" I retorted. Upon hearing her footsteps and voice in the basement, it clicked in my head that speaking was not going to help me. I continued staring at the TV (which was off the whole time).\n\nFriend A's mother sniffed the air. \"It smells down here... have you been smoking in here, A?\" Waves of trepidation. Every word she said seemed to come out of the TV, although she was actually behind me.\n\nThankfully A had not smoked yet and had prepared an excuse, \"No I was burning incense. I mean, that's obviously not the smell of cigarettes or anything, right?\" A stroke of genius; how would she know what Salvia smelled like?\n\nHis mother glanced us all over. I continued staring into the morphing TV, refusing to make eye contact. After a few uncomfortable moments, she remarked that she had forgotten her wallet and was now late for her movie. She hurriedly left the house and we all sighed in relief. My visuals started to subside.\n\nWe waited for a few minutes to calm down, then packed another bowl. This time it was Friend C's turn, at 16 she was the youngest of us all and I don't think she had experience with anything other than cannabis and alcohol. Therefore, we packed her a comparatively smaller bowl. Having seen my mistake, she knew to hold the smoke in until the effects started. Within seconds of smoking, I saw her eyes well with tears and an uncomfortable grin spread across her face. She laid back in her seat and put her hands in the air as if she was on a rollercoaster. Soon, she was laughing so hard she was crying. It sounded like she was trying to speak but could not stop laughing, she was in complete hysterics. We all watched and laughed along with her as she screamed with laughter. Within a few minutes, she was wiping the tears from her face and explaining that she actually was on a rollercoaster, and ice cream cones were the passengers. She couldn't elaborate more than that. This seemed like a very light-hearted and fun trip compared to what I had seen with the TV. In light of her hilarious trip, I decided I would re-try."

        "description": "I packed the bottom of the bong with weed, then filled the rest with Salvia and sprinkled a bit more weed on top for flavor. Looking back, I think I put about 1/4 of the gram into that bowl. I cooked the bowl much faster this time since I was aware of just how short the bioavailability really is.\n\nI held the acrid smoke in and saw the same plasticine-face effect as my friends looked at me. But this time there was a very strong rush. It felt ominous and there seemed to be a \"woosh\" sound, like when one puts one's ear to a seashell. I could tell this was going to be intense, and once again I laid back and clutched the couch. Then blackness.\n\nI opened my eyes, to see that I was standing on the edge of a plateau. The ground beneath me was powdery and orange-red, like Mars. The clear sky was a similar color, but more reddish. There were wisps of white clouds, but not many. I took a few steps toward the edge of the cliff. Far below me was a vast orange desert-badlands sort of area. The ground was cracked and dry. I heard the woosh again and looked upward; several creatures were flying overhead. They were shaped like manta rays with very long dragon-like tails. They were dark shades of purple and blue, with bumpy leathery scales. I spoke their name, which to the best of my recollection was something like \"Quixocitolix\" (no, not Quetzalcoatl). It was as though I had seen these creatures before. They did not seem dangerous, but they were worthy of my respect and appreciation.\n\nI made my way down the steep cliff-face and into the badlands. With the creatures flying overhead, and a vast plain before me, I walked for what felt like two years. I felt myself age and grow weary but I did not stop walking. Eventually, I reached a small white hut. It was somewhat like a mushroom; fat, short and round with a wider dome-like roof. It had a rounded entrance with no door and seemed very welcoming.\n\nI don't recall entering the hut, but my next memory is inside the hut. Everything was stark white. When I looked around I could not see an exit, despite the fact the entrance had no door. Behind a white rectangular counter stood a tall humanoid figure wearing a white cloak. It was like a burka, I could not see the figure's face. I slowly approached the counter.\n\nThe figure finally acknowledged my presence with a laugh. \"So... what do you think?\" Its voice was neither masculine nor feminine. It simply spoke English words, in their truest form, with no special voicing or accent. Despite that, it seemed to have an echo. I stammered \"What? Think of what?\"\n\nIt laughed very loudly and mockingly. \"The Salvia! What do you think of Salvia?\"\n\nI reeled with confusion. Salvia? This word seemed so familiar. I tried to recall how I had gotten into this room, and briefly remembered smoking with other humans in a small room. I could not remember my friends' names or faces.\n\nThe humanoid was aware of my confusion, it seemed to thrive on it. I gained momentary confidence and tried to voice my opinion on Salvia. But I could not use my mouth. The cloaked figure focused on me even more intently and began laughing louder and louder. It knew I could not speak.\n\nI felt a physical barrier between my words and my mouth. I raised my hands to the corners of my mouth and pushed forward. As I moved the block-like barrier, I heard my answer escape from my mouth; \"NO!\" The creature's eyes widened and I saw the hut-room rocket away from me; when I pushed the barrier away from myself, I had seemingly pushed myself into the realm of that \"block\".\n\nI looked at the block I had pushed off of my mouth, it was labeled with the word \"No\", the same word I had been trying to say. It was about arm-length away from me, and when I looked around I could see other similar blocks with different words on them. It slowly started to move away, and it appeared to be a wall of keyboard-like blocks, all with different words or ideas. I started to float backward, faster and faster. It wasn't a wall, it was a floor. No. It wasn't a floor, it was a plain. My mind reeled as I tried to take in all the ideas on these blocks. As I floated away I saw the full scope of the block-wall; it was a planet. I screamed. A planet made of thoughts, ideas, and words, all arranged like a keyboard. I was still floating away from the planet, into the blackness of space. \"NO NO NO NO NO!\" I continued to scream endlessly, to no avail. Then it occurred to me, if I pushed the planet away by saying the wrong word, perhaps I could get back to it by answering the white humanoid's question properly. I shouted out loud my answer to its question, I could not hear my own voice but I felt my mouth moving. Then I felt the gravity of the planet pull me back in, and I heard that familiar whoosh. I had reconnected to the ideas that made up my reality."

        "description": "For a few brief moments, I felt as though I was waking from a deep sleep. There was a blur of colors as I opened my eyes, and the basement slowly started to fade in. I recognized the people sitting around me, they all looked very sedate. I turned to Friend B, who was sitting next to me on the couch. His eyes were half-open and I could tell he was still under the effects of Salvia. It occurred to me that I had been speaking while tripping, but I couldn't remember those \"magic words\" I had said to bring me back to reality. I asked my friends, still somewhat slurred and hazy, \"What did I just say?\"\n\nThey turned to me abruptly, apparently, they hadn't realized I was sober again. \"What do you mean?\", they asked. \"When I was tripping I was speaking. What did I say?\"\n\nFriend A replied, \"Well you spent most of the time screaming your fucking head off which wasn't cool.\" His disapproval seemed inane since I didn't even know I was on the same planet as him, let alone in the same room.\n\n\"But at the end, you looked really serious and shouted \"OH GOD WHAT IS THIS I DON'T EVEN\".\"\n\nI broke out in laughter. Those were my \"magic words\"? Well, it did seem to sum up the Salvia experience pretty well, and I suppose it appeased whatever part of my mind was represented by that cloaked figure.\n\nI asked my two male friends what they saw since I already knew what C had seen because she tripped before me. Friend A told me that all the walls seemed to \"peel back\" to reveal a layer of streaming numbers beneath. I suppose you could compare that to The Matrix. Friend B, despite being the largest of us all, had a particularly low tolerance for most drugs I had seen him take. He regularly \"tripped out\" when smoking weed, in his own words. This low tolerance seemed to factor into his Salvia experience because he said it was very intense but he also could not remember anything.\n\nAfter stepping outside for some fresh air, I managed to slowly recall my entire trip and recounted it to my friends. They seemed hesitant to believe that I could have seen so much in only ten minutes, but I reminded them that I had smoked much more than they had."
      }
    ],
    "conclusion": "All-in-all, despite the overwhelming intensity and the ensuing HPPD which I have been living with, I look back on this trip fondly. It was certainly a breakthrough, and the most intense trip I have experienced to date. The fact that it felt like two years in the span of ten minutes is mind-boggling. I tried to smoke the rest of the Salvia a few weeks later with a friend, but neither of us experienced anything. I would consider doing Salvia again, but only in a much more controlled environment, and with sober trip-sitters.",

My hand twitches while I'm writing, making the act very difficult. When I close my eyes to try and note my CEVs, my eyelids twitch. The geometry in my closed and open-eyed visuals is still very mild, no more than level 3.\n\nIt's at this point that I look at the skin on my hands and arms. It looks extremely pale, rough, dotted with red spots and hair. I start to see my skin age, getting wrinkly and gray. I stand up to wash my hands and take a quick look at my face in the mirror: always a bad idea. My skin looks spotty and gross, with my face ever-so-slightly deformed. I know my skin didn't look like this before, so I brush it off with the realization that I'm tripping pretty hard and move to another room."

I can see eyes popping up in my skin, on paper, and other textures.

Everything I'm looking at gradually shifts slightly closer and further away. I start to stare at my cat laying in front of us on the sofa. He looks so much closer, while the area of the sofa he's laying on looks much farther away. I start to take note of his fur and how light bounces off it. The chromatic aberration is extremely apparent by now. I feel as though I can see the aberration in alternating colour schemes, RGB and CMY. The colours are drifting back and forth to their point of origin. The colour that sticks out to me the most is green, as it seems to be the colour that is separated the farthest. "

I'm really loving the duration of this substance, as well. It really doesn't last long and I don't have to devote half of a day to tripping. I plan to take 60 mg the next time I take this drug.",

Each time I washed my face with cold water, it felt calming in a way. I couldn't really feel the water afterwards, though I could touch my face with my hands and feel it was wet. Just had a slight tingling sensation and the droplets of water that I could feel influenced the patterns of the CEVs, which was really interesting. Walking was hard, and because I haven't seen it described in DXM trip reports before I'd like to go into it. Opening and closing doors is a hit or miss because I simply don't understand how much effort it takes to open and close it, or more accurately, I feel entirely weightless and doing anything of the sort is entirely effortless. I'd bet a punch from someone on DXM would hurt really hard given just how much you underestimate your strength on it. Hilariously enough, the robowalk is very real and results in having to hold onto something while getting up, and I got into bed by basically throwing myself against it. Not sure which is more of a reason, whether it's from physical euphoria of enjoying being dizzy from fast movement or from entirely not understanding what weight is. "

Text doesn't really do it justice, the body euphoria was extremely nice, as was feeling like I was floating or swimming at times. I'd like to experience it again in a couple of weeks, and in the meanwhile I'm hoping the dissociation from the experience will help me control dissociation while entirely sober.\n\nI would like to touch on just how nice the entire experience was despite not really talking about current emotion all that much in the report, all in all it was extremely euphoric and warm, put me into a very cuddly mood and I was just overall extremely happy. I was fairly surprised early on how I felt, considering how I had felt earlier I didn't expect it to pick up my mood by that much, and that feeling extended far into the afterglow. Currently still very content as of 17:18, just taking a lot of time to organize my thoughts and emotions.\n\nDuring the several hour peak I was very enjoyably dissociated, and I think this is the first time I've let myself just entirely let go. Just leave my fate to the metaphorical ocean which I was swimming in. \n\nI was just in pure bliss, entirely relaxed and just enjoying not having to worry about anything, and enjoying being in a sociable and almost stupidly happy state.\n\nI've also been really glad to have been able to do reflection on myself, and been more motivated to work on fixing my own problems than I was before, as any form of motivation was a problem before. It also helps to now have all those problems just presented to me like a list to fix and check off one by one, without needing to worry about how much progress I've made or not wanting to start because it's no longer as daunting as it seemed before.\n\nI'd also like to reiterate how words don't do nearly enough justice to the entire experience, I know it's something I'll savor and learn from for quite a while. I'm really happy to have found this substance that works really well for me without negative side effects.",

Previous trips I had a sort of mental block that prevented me from taking the big hits that would send me to hyperspace. That block was gone; I was ready to experience the full power of DMT. My roommate is sitting next to me, ready to take the bong from me. I readied myself and took the first hit. It was massive, to full lung capacity. As I held it it I felt it start to creep up on me. What was I doing? I reminded myself to take a second hit. I took it as things started to lose meaning around me. For a few seconds it persisted like this. I could feel the DMT on the cusp of unleashing itself, like standing near the edge of a cliff. My roommate took the bong.

I felt as if I was passing through a tunnel of sorts throughout the trip, I see what appears to be architecture and defined rooms colored orange and white. This is a very similar \"place\" ive experienced before on DMT. At one point I was in a partially transluctent room in the stars. The edges where visible by where they bended the light of the surrounding cosmos. Early into my breakthrough I met an entity, who acted as a narrator of sorts for part of the trip. The entity was humorous, and seemed to find my presence humorous. I experienced egodeath, complete oneness with the current moment and all that I was experiencing. The entity seemed amused at my lack of comphrension while going through egodeath. There was an irony in the significance I put in breaking through under the lens of my ego and how much I could absorb directly. The entity told/imparted on me wisdom about the cosmos and the universe and I absorbed it silently. There was a strong sense that the universe is a lot stranger than what we experience. Something Rick and Morty esque like the universe being a computer program that some 5th dimensional being left running on their computer seemed entirely possible. I certainly felt that way as I was seeing this alien world.\n\nAs I started to come down I tried to ask about knowledge that I could apply to my life. The being was reproachful, \"they always seek personal gain\". I recognized my mistake, which felt incredibly silly to even ask due to the insignificance of my earthly worries. From here, the trip shifted towards a dialogue. I wondered if the being was telling me what I wanted to hear. I started to challenge what the being was saying to me. Not challenge, but try my hardest to analyze what it was saying and hold it to logical scrutiny. I noticed a plot structure in my trip and wondered if the positive feelings it was giving me were a form of wish fulfillment, or at least constructed by my conscience. I found myself feeling unity with the universe, having no fear of death, and having no uncertainty, my beliefs weren't being contradicted. This is probably because of past experiences. I realized that I was constructing the entire filter of my perception, as long as there was an I there would be that filter. Furthermore, everything that happens in the universe is completely insignificant yet perfectly meaningful.\n\nI thought before that overanalyzing an entity might diminish the effect of the trip. I was incredibly wrong. By engaging the entity, which I think was the embodiment of the trip, I learned so much more than I ever would've otherwise. My skepticism brought great joy. My trip changed, I had stepped off a train following a fixed course from start to finish that was predetermined by the person I was when I entered the trip. There is great importance in the truth, in what is. Truth is one of the highest virtues to strive for, and the entity seemed to respect me much more for having asked it questions and remained skeptical than blankly accepting the course of the trip. Then I wondered if the trip was still being constructed by my conscience. Was my questioning scripted in from the beginning of the trip, was it just another part of the trip experience? I thought it was likely, since i already held truth in high regard."

I was so happy and I did not feel any anxiety at all. The clouds had faces. Visuals were floating around in the air instead of staying on the ground.\n\nThere was a very large nearly invisible/translucent entity standing in the middle of the sidewalk and road. It looked like some kind of dinosaur/rhino spirit animal. I couldn’t interact with it, it was just standing there. I moved out of the way of the animal and actually crossed the street to the other sidewalk because I did not want to walk inside of it. For some reason, I suspected that walking inside the animal would trigger ego death and I did not wish to experience this in the middle of the street."

I experienced the third truth from the “[Psychedelic exposure to the inner mechanics of consciousness and its relationship to states of unity and interconnectedness](https://disregardeverythingisay.com/post/40546416868/psychedelic-exposure-to-the-inner-mechanics-of)\" post on disregardeverythingisay.com. I've pasted an excerpt of this below:\n\n*\"The psychedelic disintegration of this apparent illusion is commonly described as a loss of perceived boundaries between the physical body and the external environment, giving the profound sensation that you can no longer understand where your physical body ends and the external environment begins. Our central centre of self with which we identify as “ourselves” is at this point, revealed to be illusory and not any single component of our being, such as the ego, the brain as a whole or even the body in its entirety. Instead, the central centre of self with which we identify with becomes no single component of existence but all of it in its entirety, creating the sudden undeniable perspective that you are literally the entire universe experiencing itself and performing actions onto itself through the very specific point of space and time which your ego happens to reside in. The ego or self as separate from external systems of behaviour is felt to be an elaborate fabrication, that the skin is not what separates us from the universe but what connects us to it. This is a feeling that when experienced is immediately and universally understood to be an undeniable truth by anybody who undergoes it.\"*"

    "conclusion": "This truth has changed my life and it was the most powerful thing I had experienced at the time.. Almost a year later, I still see everyone as myself. You are me and I am you. I experience frission/asmr and whenever I read something that has to do with unity sober (like in Buddhism texts), I get a feeling of intense frisson that feels like I am having a mind orgasm and moves throughout my entire body. I now find it impossible to hate others or be mad at anyone ever because I realize that I am them. It is incredibly hard to explain, but the description linked above matches what I felt and still feel perfectly. I consider this shroom trip one of the greatest days of my life, but it doesn’t come close to what happened when I took LSD a few days ago.",

    "introduction": "I had a bad trip on 20mg of 4-aco-dmt. It was not terrible nor was it too upsetting, but it was a great reminder for me about proper set and setting. I should not have tripped that day. First of all, I had already tripped. I had a great trip a couple days ago, and I should have waited. I was having trouble with my boyfriend. He wasn't responding to his phone (he was in another city) and I was scared that he didn’t like me anymore and was going to break up with me.\n\nSo with all this on my mind, I still decided to trip. I went outside, but all I could fucking think about was my relationship problems. I didn’t know what to do. I decided I’d have to go inside because I couldn’t take it outside. I went inside, but I felt weird. I didn’t feel good… I just felt alien. I felt like a robot… It was so strange being human, at the time. I tried everything I could to stop the bad trip. I didn't have any visuals.\n\nI tried singing and dancing. It was not a terrible trip, but I felt afterwards, that it had exposed me to my darkest places… My fears… I have so much to deal with. I decided to drink. I felt good for a while but the feeling left me and my boyfriend finally called me. He broke up with me over the phone. I cried and had a panic attack. It was terrible. He was drunk and sorry that he had broken up with me while I was having a bad trip.\n\nI took opiates and drank the rest of my alcohol. I cried so fucking much. And for a few days after that, there was no happiness. I needed time to heal. I felt like all of my faults had been unleashed to me.\n\nI decided to stop tripping for awhile until I got caught up with my problems and fixed some things in my life."

    "introduction": "It began with a night of binging 3-MeO-PCP. I had been using a large amount of the substance, working my way through about 500mg over the course of a month. During these trips, I had previously begun to experience \"the fear\" for the first time. My first experience with it being that of sudden onset panic attacks consisting of an intense fear that abruptly awoke me from sleep in a frenzy. These lasted only about 2 minutes each but they foreshadowed the ever escalating madness that ensued.\n\nI had promised myself that I would give up 3-MeO-PCP due to the sheer intensity of these experiences, which were unlike any other I've felt on a drug. I am experienced with deliriants, salvia, and various psychedelics, but the deep pitted existential terror perpetrated by this substance was unparalleled.\n\nThe only thing that surpassed the intensity of this fear was the extremely strong addictive qualities of the substance. Me being a dissonaut with addictive tendencies, I quickly found myself redosing frequently every single day.\n\nNow when you're on 3-MeO-PCP, you don't get psychosis or the fear during the trip itself, when you're on it you just feel extremely manic. Instead, you typically feel the psychosis and the fear when you are coming down during the tail end of the trip. When you think you're now sober.",

I weighed the powder out with the desire to listen to classical music and experience nice visuals.\n\n\nI lay in my bed with my tablet as I began to come up hard and I struggled as a deep confoundment overtook me. I attempted to put on a piece of music: York Bowens Symphony no 2. This is a beautiful yet menacing composition that I was only able to get playing through extreme struggle. I remember thinking how difficult it was to navigate reality, my vision was deeply altered and it wasn’t normal visuals. It felt as though I couldn’t focus my eyes and my pupils were dilating in and out. I turned off the lights in an attempt to rectify the situation but it only made it worse.\n\n\nI felt a great intoxication and impairment overtake me. I could not manage to navigate the tablet. It was as though brain was unable to render the visual stimuli and i was left with a barrage of incomprehensible noise. The music made little sense to me in this state and I felt completely helpless. I stumbled over to my desktop computer after throwing my tablet on the floor and I crawled into the chair. I was completely unable to comprehend what I was perceiving. \n\nAs a layer of unmanageable visuals clouded my field of view I managed to bring up the York Bowen symphony no. 2 only through muscle memory. I don’t believe I was able to comprehend how to use the headphones unfortunately but this symphony would have an extremely large impact on my experience nonetheless."

        "description": "This is when my psyche began to unravel. I was in a trance for a good period of time before the paranoia hit. I remember hearing church bells toll that didnt exist, play a melancholy tone. I perceived these as my funeral bells. I started hearing sirens blare and I could percieve my entire family exchanging exasperated concerns for my well being with deep Diaspointment *“He did it again, dissociatives”*. I felt my heart race as I began to panic.\n\n\nI could feel my family was on their way and perceived a phone call take place that I conversed in. \"*Yes this is the dissociative overdose hotline, beware of DXM abuse*\". They instinctually knew I had overdosed on 3-MeO-PCP, I vocally begged to live, I frantically tossed shelves and broke a picture frame looking for an antidote , all the while begging for redemption from God. I felt I was being punished for being a non believer. I screamed in horror as I felt myself talking to a friend while begging for an antidote to my fatal poisoning. A poisoning which was slowly encroaching towards my demise as my hallucinated friend exclaimed in an irritated tone, “*really ! Not 3meopcp! hold on I’ll see what I can do Jesus Christ!*” I heard sirens blare and the tolls of death grew ever louder.\n\nI was pleading on the imaginary dissociative hotline. As I felt myself slipping away I felt incredible guilt and desolution. I felt that I had become a prime example of the downfalls of drug use. I felt I was the patient zero of a dissociative crisis. I looked at my computer and saw the youtube page with the header. York Bowen Symphony No. 2. I felt I was commiting “York Bowen”, a euphemism for suicide. I screamed begging saying “*I didn’t mean too!*”. I saw pages of what I had become flash all over the internet and I was known as the person who committed suicide by York Bowen. I felt this deep tragedy as I felt my existence dissapear. Everything ever associated with my identity had become “York Bowen”. I viewed articles of my demise. It was as if my existence had been wiped off the face of the earth, and I had become the first person to die of 3-meo-pcp. I screamed: \"*FUCK. FUCK NO.*\"\n\nThe worst part about my death was that I would live an identity free life in an eternal purgatory where I lacked identity but roamed in a void of pitiful nothingness that was a copy of this world. A place where nothing I did, said, or interacted with would matter and where I completely lacked the ability to influence or interact with any aspect of existence, and that this was entirely eternal. I could hear sirens blare unbearably loud at this point along with the sounds of screams and church bells which tolled the same melancholy tone\n\nI screamed and ripped more things from the bookcase throwing all its contents to the floor, exposing the mg scale. I screamed an anguished cry heard by no one and slipped into brief unconsciousness.\n\nWhen I awoke I heard more sirens and a pounding on my door. I was naked when I woke up and the pounding grew ever louder. I had the perception that the police were after me for an imaginary Meth operation and I imagined the entire community mocking me. The pounding wouldn’t cease so I opened up the door and was met with nothing. Nobody was there. The colors outside were incredibly bright and vibrant. After hiding all my drugs in obscure places, I fell out of this state of psychosis and fell into deep mania. I poured soap into my hair and lathered it up and then filled a bathtub with water. I felt on top of the world because I felt my actions had no consequence.\n\nI felt as though nothing I did mattered because I would just die and return into the flow of everything again before starting anew with my form unchanged. I sprayed dish liquid all over the walls and ceiling for reasons I can’t explain. I passed out in the bathtub while the front door of my apartment was wide open. I must of been passed out for at least an hour. When I got out I decided I would just go outside to air dry myself instead of using a towel, despite being completely naked. I felt like I was in San Francisco in the 1960s, a hippy throwing caution to the wind. Luckily my better judgement overtook me. before I went too far, a good thing considering I lived on a main road in downtown. From here I passed out, mentally and physically exhausted."

Most of my awake moments only involved me opening my eyes, mumbling a few words and passing back out again a few seconds later. However, I can remember specific events occurring.\n\nThis is where I reached the 3rd/4th plateau. I was feeling completely detached from my body, like I was just a mind that was completely separated from anything. Everytime I had to move, I would just find myself in the place I needed to be, with barely any recollection of the actually transition from one room to another. It was as though my body was on autopilot, all I had to do was think about going somewhere and I would suddenly be in that room. The parts where I remember walking, it was very difficult to control my motor control, and getting anywhere required holding onto walls, banisters etc the whole way.\n\nI remember feeling very disorientated, and panicking that my parents had been trying to get in touch with me. I tried looking at my phone, but where my vision was blurry, I couldn't make out any of the writing on the screen, meaning I couldn't tell whether I had been called. In the end, my sitter had to remove my phone and turn it off, to prevent me from calling my parents. I was repeatedly asking my sitter whether I had been contacted, but then forgetting I had asked seconds later. I apparently kept asking where I was, due to the memory loss, and had to be calmed down as I was appearing to be becoming scared.\n\nThe visual side of the trip wasn't as strong as the dissociating side. However, I remember on several occasions flying through a void, surrounded by pixelated buildings (think Minecraft). The colors were darker than I experience on psychedelics like LSD and psilocin; mostly the darker shades, or greys/metallic colors.\n\nDuring the brief periods where my eyes were open, I remember thinking that everything had a very Cubist/Picasso look to it. It was as though any object I looked at had been chopped up, and rearranged. As well as looking different, objects had completely different textures to what I was used to. The whole room was blurry and I was experiencing double vision when I tried to focus on one particular thing. When just glancing briefly upon anything, although I had no double vision, the object would leave behind blurred tracers.\n\nAt several points during the trip, I remember seeing people I knew in the room that weren't actually there. One hallucination I had was where the trip I was currently having and a memory of a trip with three of my friends merged together. The friends in my hallucination I actually saw seated around me and moving. However, outside of that hallucination, any people that weren't physically in the room, I could just feel a sort of presence of."

I could keep my eyes open for longer, and could start to talk more easily. I still had memory loss; minutes would feel like hours. I had a period of feeling about a foot shorter that I really was. If I looked down at my legs, they looked incredibly short. My surroundings seemed larger than normal too. I was also left with an afterglow of feeling rather awake and talkative, staying up until 3am talking. Food also tasted bland or just had no taste, as well as the textures feeling slimier than normal. After the peak of ego death, I said several times that I regretted taking the DXM and wouldn't do it again. However, the further away I got from ego death, the more I started to consider DXM to be one of the more interesting and profound trips I've ever had."

Closed eye visuals are astral and spectacular, with scenes of floating through stars or other beautiful spaces. The CEV’s are cartoony and oversaturated in appearance, and not really patterned as much as they are an intricate assortment of random shapes. All of the letters on the screen appear to be at different depths. Moving around the room begins to feel so automatic that it feels like some invisible force is pulling me around on a rope.\n\nMy computer looks tiny and the open eyed visuals shift to the appearance of some sort of grey wind blowing around me, it is a feeling I get from dissociatives where it feels like I am being blasted in the face with a hose. I get an eerie feeling of another presence in the room that usually only comes from DXM… I feel like dancing, and dance around my room. The only thoughts I can even remotely piece together are along the lines of “Holy shit this is stronger than I expected and its not letting up!” and “Wow its wild I just threw some powder in my mouth and now look where I am” I am lying on my floor looking at the ceiling, watching the forms of my room bubble up and flow around me, the ceiling looking like a swirling river, just thinking “wow I’m so fucked up this feels like a dream.”\n\n\nI feel like I am made of clay, I am very weightless but lack muscle control and my limbs are subject to gravity. I feel soft and squishy. I feel like I am being washed over by waves that smooth out and dissolve my form. It is like a current is flowing around me, dragging me around, as the trip becomes more and more intense it is like I am being pulled out to sea and sinking under, I have to remind myself to breathe (I am definitely still breathing autonomically but it feels like I have to do it consciously), and this only increases the feeling. If I close my eyes it literally just feels like I’m swimming with cold currents streaming around me, it's wonderful.\n\nThis feels a lot like MXE, it feels like a total adventure, but it also feels a lot flatter and heavier, lacking the lightness and giddiness and euphoria of MXE, and just being a wild ride. I feel like I was pretty in a hole at many points. Perhaps the most prominent was when I began to sort through my memories of a recent vacation to Italy with my parents a week before. I relived all the memories in vivid detail that could only be read and told through feeling and essence, not simply rebuilt from the aesthetic phenomena I experienced. It was the same thoughts and emotions I felt while I was there, but it felt so 3rd person, it was like I was in a theater watching a 1st person film not made from sound or image but from feeling, the amount of light, the weather of the day, my parents moods, my own moods, the color of the sky, the way the air smelled how it looked, or the way the oppressive sun beat down on so many stark ancient things, my heart rate and the people I thought about and the books I read and a multimedia memory experience (or maybe play told through my point of view would be more appropriate?) I began to notice I was coming down when I could not only easily shift out of these strange transfers to memories or subconscious worlds, but was also unable to return to them."

After a really dizzying struggle I finally manage to get it to work.

My motor skills are still pretty compromised and I almost fall down the stairs going to class the next day. I feel euphoric and spacey, colors look brighter. This doesn’t wear off until I’ve been awake for about 6 hours.\n\nMXM is an ample substitute for MXE in my opinion. It has slightly shorter duration and the experience itself lacks the inherent euphoria and giddiness, but has that same sense of whimsy, adventure, and motion, and is substantially powerful. To note however: About a month later after the MXE ban my dealer and I both went back to our doses of MXM and found them to be a degree less potent than before.",

Though at first glance you may think the F denotes a Fluorine, in this case it actually stands for a “formyl” group, the same active group found in formic acid produced by ants. It came to me in the form of tabs dosed at ~100 μg. I didn’t have much to work with and the 1-substituted LSD analogues have all so far demonstrated consistent properties in terms of potency and effects, so I conjectured that it would be safe to dive right in with my standard lysergamide dose of 150 μg. I do not recommend ever doing this for novel substances, though I deemed it an acceptable risk for myself that I was ready to take responsibility for. I was also informed that it appeared to be less stable than other lysergamides, something to consider for anyone who may try to store it long term. I personally do not know if or when this chemical will be more widely available, but I was extremely grateful for the opportunity to try it out and create data on this entirely new compound. I hope it will be of benefit to future researchers.",

I walk past filthy blighted buildings, forgotten piles of overgrown waste and rubble strewn about under sooty freight train and highway viaducts, substations and rusting factories towering over the streets nearby. The lanes are wide and most commercial space is gas stations and auto repair shops- a place meant for driving and not walking. Everything is choked with urban weeds.\nI am feeling a bit queasy, though not from the smells, I have a decent tolerance for bad smells. This is the typical jitters I get in my gut while coming up from psychedelics. I begin to see light visuals in the clouds- new textures and patterns gently traced through their forms, barely discernible.

Some people are hanging around a skatepark under a bridge but I don’t feel uncomfortable walking past them even as the drug seeps more and more into my head. Nevertheless, I find a nice secluded spot by the water: the remains of a crumbled concrete retaining wall where I can stretch out and rest undisturbed. I am definitely tripping now, feeling it primarily in my body as the normal queasiness and stimulation that psychedelics give me- I notice it that it isn’t the usual uncomfortable overstimulation that rocks me with tremors, nor is it the painful debilitating nausea I sometimes get. It is all entirely tolerable.\n\nI watch birds of prey circle overhead- a screeching osprey circles above the river while an occasional red-tailed hawk darts between the trees across the water. I am surrounded on all sides by trees and life and it feels so idyllic and peaceful. The water itself is a swirling opaque sludge with rafts of trash and oily slime drifting by, to be expected of a main artery through a major city on a summer day after a rain.\n\nI try to stare into the clouds and focus on the visuals- still unremarkable, still faint ghostly images that only appear when I focus on them. With my eyes closed I see little but shifting spots of color. Something is definitely coursing through me right now, but it escapes solid definition, elusive like a fly avoiding being swatted. Cognitively, I am mostly ruminating about my life and circumstances. I feel good. My internal voice sounds more coherent and articulate than it normally does. I smoke a joint of some mids that I had leftover (note: I almost always smoke a bit of cannabis with psychedelics. In my extensive experience I have tried psychedelics both alone and with cannabis- as a frequent daily cannabis user, it does not affect the nature of the trip for me, it only seems to increase visual potency and take the edge off of the body load. This may be different for other people, but for me personally its effects are near-negligible.)"

I think about how old I am, how much life I may still potentially have, what the far future may look like, for me personally. My thoughts flow freely and easily. The visuals steadily become deeper and better defined, but are still relatively slight. The clouds hovering overhead pick up a sickly iridescent sheen around their edges and through their curves.

It sits on its prey for a second, gives me a knowing look, then takes off across the river, carrying its catch underneath it. It was one of the coolest things I had ever seen, it was exhilarating that I had been still enough that this mighty predator trusted me to be an accomplice to its hunt. I could feel the wind from its wings, if I had been sitting upright it probably would’ve clipped me in the face with one. Absolutely incredible.\n\nAs I’m reeling from this I begin to notice the visuals become more apparent- fronds and fans sprout through the sky, forms reminiscent of dendritic manganese crystals, but pulsing with dull color. The clouds have an advancing front of writhing, curving branched forms forming an expanding front of pulsing color, leaving fields of iridescent sparkling bubbles in their wake. An energetic euphoria wells up inside of me I am so content to be here right now, no responsibilities to worry about, a beautiful patch of filthy nature in an industrial heart of the city, the sun and warmth beating down on me, so much life still managing to struggle and fight to exist around me. What a beautiful and idyllic day, despite all the filth and trash drifting by, despite the landfill odor that hangs in the air. With other lysergamides I usually have distinctly patterned visuals taking the form of faces, figures, animals, all in the style of many different kinds of indigenous American art. These visuals from this however are more freeform, unbounded and seemingly organic and improvised.\n\nI’m watching more and more hawks that seem to have appeared across the river, they flit from tree to tree and circle above, soaring without flapping their wings, subtly adjusting themselves so they can ride updrafts and circle with minimal effort. One grabs something from a tree. What incredible, impressive, competent creatures, so perfectly adapted for hunting and killing.\n\nClosing my eyes yields symmetrical visuals - blobs of gradated color, like a thermal vision of a Rorschach test, eternally shifting and morphing and forming into new shapes.\n"

How all of our fates had suddenly collided, how it was just another normal day of that hawk deciding to be the portal between another animal’s life and death, as it had likely done to hundreds of other creatures that had live full lives before.\n\nAs I ruminate and meditate more and more on my lovely dirty bit of concrete by the fetid water, I find myself thinking more and more about things in their entirety, thinking about their origins and the entire courses of their existence and their influence into the future beyond their physical presence. It is a pleasant and calm trip, there is no rush or stress or excess nervous energy, I am shaking a bit but it is not the overclocked intensity that psychedelics can sometimes instill. I’m doing just as I need to be doing.\n\nVisuals begin to project into the sky with greater force, fountains of branching patterns blossoming up into the apex of the great dome above with electric buoyancy. Dull colored waves roll through the clouds, a subtle iridescent gradient running between their peaks and troughs.

There are all sorts of joggers and passersby, people exercising after their working days, taking their dogs and children out to get some fresh air. I avoid contact with most people beyond passing glances. I don’t feel particularly awkward actually, it might have even been pleasant to stop and talk to these strangers, but I avoid it anyway. This is a fairly lucid and functional experience so far. I end up on another bridge on the other side of the park. This one has turreted guard towers with little recessed spaces next to them where I can hide from passing traffic. I eat a snack and smoke a little bit more weed, which seems to breathe just a little more life into the visuals. I look out over the river, at the city skyline, nice cooling gusts waft by as the sound of traffic in the background reverberates and echoes into the summer sky. The clouds sigh and heave with color while the towering glass buildings pulse with reflected golden light from the West. I am in the same part of town as my weed dealer so I decide I’m lucid enough to hit him up and set up a purchase."

My voice sounds awkward and ungainly, but I am able to communicate outwardly without issue. I am definitely still feeling the drug as I walk, though I am definitely on the downturn now. There is a bounce and a spring in my step, my limbs feel both heavy and light. Visuals have begun to die down. Brief moments of seeing passersby or catching snippets of their conversations sear into my memory, as often happens with psychedelics. It feels like the world around me is sagging to my weight like a gravity well, but I am very very comfortable with this experience and its intensity. As I walk through a college campus en route to meet him, I become immersed in thinking about the novelty of this experience, how I am one of just a few people in the world so far to have tasted this drug, how the exact pattern of thoughts and neurotransmitter flow through my brain may be entirely unique to this substance and how it is something I have technically never experienced before. I love this sense of discovery and novelty and it makes the experience all the more exciting."

The change of setting seemed to intensify the effects a bit. I read about news stories on my phone - the big story of the day is the scandal with a bunch of high-profile twitter accounts being hacked. I get lost in thinking about the possible ramifications of that. I wait for about 20 minutes before he shows up. Interacting is awkward and I now have a big stinky bag of cannabis in my backpack. I set out for home as its starting to get late. For most of the walk home I am entirely lost in thought. I walk by little scenes of conflict, of people interacting or hanging out at tables outside of restaurants.  These provide punctuated moments in my memory that bust through my immersion in my own thoughts, little vignettes that break up the monotony of my walk and stick in my memory. My thoughts are manic, fantasies about things I can do to fulfill my wants and needs in this world."

Nonetheless, looking at the exquisite details and textures on each little insect is exhilarating. There is so much beauty contained in these little things, each one like its own alien landscape.

    "conclusion": "Theoretically, there is very strong evidence that indole N-substituted lysergamides (1P-LSD, 1A-LSD, 1B-LSD, 1cP-LSD, ALD-52 etc.) are simply prodrugs for LSD, and would not be considered functionally distinct.  There is particularly strong evidence supporting 1P-LSD and ALD-52 as a prodrugs to LSD (Grumann et al. 2020, Halberstadt et al. 2019), and a strong suggestion that this pattern continues with 1B-LSD (Halberstadt et al. 2019). There is no specific data to suggest this is the case for other indole N-substituted lysergamides and there is 0 existing data on 1F-LSD, but it is highly likely that it may also be a prodrug for LSD. Curiously, in my personal experience, I have noticed subjective differences between all of the indole N-substituted lysergamides I have tried. 1F-LSD was no exception to this rule- I would characterize it by conjecturing a lower potency and shorter duration than LSD or other indole N-substitutions, though this requires a larger sample size to say so with confidence. \n\nIt had a distinct visual character- while for me many other lysergamides create aforementioned discrete and distinct contained visuals following animal forms and resembling various kinds of indigenous American art, 1F-LSD had a character of more organic, free flowing visuals, with less color. The headspace was subtle and euphoric, given to earnest but pleasant and merciful introspection, with a lot of holistic reflection on contentedness and the passage of time. There was also distinctly little body load or anxiety, a gentle, blissful trip that came and went quickly and didn’t impose itself at any point. While with other similar compounds, particularly 1-cP-LSD, the visuals stuck around well into the comedown, with 1F-LSD, they were one of the first aspects of the experience to recede. All in all it is a pleasant and fun compound that’s good for a day out. It didn’t particularly stand out relative to other similar compounds but some may find use in its uniquely pleasant and gentle character. This may also all just be the subjectivity of a single experience based on the set and setting of what very well may have just been transformed to regular LSD inside of my body. Only more data and research will tell!",

I feel distant, wiped clean, left to simply observe as my internal self is siphoned away with my sense of a body, leaving some dreadfully neutral phantom placeholder of a person in its place.

I am caught off guard by the sudden intensity of this experience.\nI have distinct closed eyed visuals of distant murky skyscrapers encircling the immense swallowing void that I am descending into. Bits and pieces of recent memories float by, visual cues of places I had been earlier that day and the day before, of the sights I saw and the feelings I felt. I feel like I am treading water in the middle of a vast ocean, these little flecks of memory like pieces of flotsam after a shipwreck, drifting by on the currents. Most notably however, memories from far before begin to trickle in too, in even greater clarity than the recent ones, vivid experiences from my teenage years, of who I was and how I felt through my tumultuous and awkward puberty. It is pleasant to see and acknowledge and dance with these deeply buried memories, to know that they are still deep within my brain somewhere. But it is fleeting, they drift by like all the others in this big empty current and my cognitive function is so disrupted that I feel like I can’t really give them full consideration, just aimlessly grope around their essence.\n\nWith my eyes open it looks like everything is flashing, just relentlessly strobing like seeing the lights of an emergency vehicle cast on a brick wall. I am just a quiet witness to this. Broad stripes of color and discolor steadily march down my vision, all of it feels so matter of fact and beyond my control. There are strong notable flashing afterimages when I close my eyes.\n\n Most of the dissociation is centered on my skull now, it feels like a weighted object floating in the void. The bodily dissociation is an afterthought, there’s none of the intense active disintegration of feeling, but rather simply a stark and blank absence of sensing my body at all. It feels as though the lower half of my body is just unraveling and streaming away. Nonetheless, if I want to get up and move I can with little trouble, walking up and down stairs to refill my water is slightly confusing but not as challenging as it is with other heavy doses of dissociatives. I would for the most part describe it as a sedating sensation, where I can really only move if I force myself to. Otherwise I am still, dead weight, feeling little motivation to do more than lie there like a ragdoll. My body feels like a mannequin that doesn’t actually belong to me, just some limp form my mind is appended to. I feel like I’m tripping over my words as I type, it is hard to recall how to use them properly. It is a very empty and confusing space that I am embedded in."

I listen to music but the visuals are not very synesthetic, there is this ultimate sense of just being at the mercy of the flow of this trip, like bobbing on an unstable raft in a middle of a wide river. My body continues to swirl and wind away, negated into absence without issue or distinction, just quiet and neutral and natural and gentle. It feels like ghosts are moving around me, just a sense of some fluttering other brushing me, but it is invisible and indistinct, as everything in this experience is, a huge voluminous phantom with nothing at its core. Everything is so distinctly smoothed down like it has been sanded, no sharp edges, no punctuated anything, just broad heavy and flat neutrality. Vividly grey emptiness. It is neither warm nor cold, it is not active or passive, it just is, quietly and indistinctly. It evades identification, like a face seen in a dream formed from so many faces seen before. It is elusive in its vacuity.\n\nI’m so dizzy, it genuinely feels like things are spilling out of my brain. I am so confused and lost and adrift, I am frozen in place by the incapacitating empty nonsense of this. My brain is so used to forming thoughts, making sense of things, and all of that has been frozen. Now there is nothing to do, nothing to know. All I can do is just exist. "

It induced an absolute absence of anything, producing a vast empty void. My brain was left to fill in the gaps. It felt like being adrift in a vast ocean, difficult to form any kind of coherent thoughts or grasp onto anything, just aimless flailing into a yawning nothing. There is no rush, no active intense dissociation, it’s a passive neutral dissociation from a total absence of feeling. The only similarities it had to other PCP analogues was that it wasn’t very physically incapacitating- my body felt like a blank empty mannequin but it wasn’t distorted away as other dissociatives will do, it was just drained of its substance. This drug primarily yielded an extremely intense cognitive dissociation that left me shocked and dumbfounded. No mania, no stimulation, no anything, just pure neutrality and blank emptiness. The cognitive space of the hole tugged gently at memories and associations but they were still distant and indistinct. It is a good way to blur the mind for a time. Also notable was how suddenly and intensely it came and went. It took an hour for an intense peak to set in, which receded without fanfare after about another hour. Most of the comedown was a sense of feeling dazed as I approached baseline. Also noteworthy is the low potency and the intense discomfort of administering it intranasally. It is fairly caustic and other experiments have demonstrated it is active orally and sublingually with a slightly longer duration and similar dose to intranasal, so those are probably better methods of dosing it.",

I feel as though I have a better sense of depth perception, and like I can pick up on the minutiae of every texture, every surface. Shadows are darker, lights are lighter, but the contrast doesn’t make things appear overexposed, rather it makes everything appear more ‘real’ than it really is. There is also a strobing, twitching effect. My entire field of vision would be shaking and vibrating and pulsing, but every now and then it would rapidly twitch, shake, and shudder. Imagine watching a wasp, how as it crawls around on flowers it occasionally rapidly beats its wings. This is what my entire field of vision was doing.\n\nI feel so smiley I just want to hug my bed and roll around on soft surfaces. I know I act like a fool when I go on social media and try to digitally communicate with people while on empathogens, but I kindly remind myself not to do that this time, to keep this overwhelming euphoria to myself. I do tell my girlfriend however. I was apprehensive of doing so before because I felt like it might not bode well, but now that I was happily under the influence, all that anxiety lifted and I felt no issue with being open with her.

This concluded in me taking the tabs in the stall of a very crowded public bathroom. After this I set off to walk towards one of the rivers that ran by the city. I wanted to smoke a little as I came up, because that always acted to my benefit. By the time I reach the river I can feel the drug flow through my veins with burgeoning intensity.

The light sounds like an angelic chorus. As I draw, I become obsessed with the quality of my lines, the power imbued in each line rather than the holistic image. I try to create a sort of chaotic coherency by placing lines at random and trusting that my elevated state would subconsciously allow me to arrange them in a beautiful, harmonious, and coherent image. Eventually, the lines become cathartic- through a visual-auditory synesthesia I can hear each line scream as I forcefully drag them on the page. Graceful lines become jagged screaming marks, each one circling and contorting with explosive release. I want to be physically screaming out loud, but I still have the judgment to not do that, as I am in public."

I was reading on my computer, but I soon noticed that words began to be incomprehensible, and soon the letters themselves morphed into illegible glyphs. I began to feel my body lightening and fading away. My sense of proportion became warped. Sounds began to echo and ricochet off each other in a visual space. My depth perception broke down as the room before me became a flat space being viewed from every direction at once, overlaid with gridlike patterns. I closed my eyes and faded into a space where all my senses were united in perceiving an odd shape that I couldn’t necessarily describe as 3-dimensional, as it broke all sorts of laws of perspective and depth. I was bodiless in this state, my entire existence was encompassed in this anomalous form.\n\nInterestingly, if I opened my eyes and willed myself to focus I could pull myself from this transdimensional (?) state and experience a very altered version of my sober reality (rather than a different reality altogether). My walls were twisting and warping in every direction and my room was simultaneously very small and very large. When I laid down I felt like I was flying. It was indescribably immaculate and thrilling, I don’t think I have ever felt better while under the influence of a drug. I fiddled my fingers and cried tears of joy at the complexity of strangeness of my hands. My nails tapped out rhythms on the walls and each tap resonated like ripples through the twisting and swirling room. I was twitching and contorting my body because it felt so amazing to feel the ways in which I could move this fleshy frame.\n\nAt one point I twisted so hard It felt like my entire skeleton popped out alignment with one another. This feeling didn’t go away until much later that night. I pressed my outstretched hand against the wall and felt a torrent of energy enter my body from that point of contact. A concentric radiating pattern exploded out from that point. Though it was probably just a visual reaction based on the position of my arm, it felt as though I communed with some being through my wall and pulled energy from it.\n\nNo words can really describe the immense bliss of this leg of the trip, I felt like I was at the apex of my life. Unlike the previous experience with MDMA and mushrooms where it was a very odd chemical bliss, this felt like a cognitive bliss that came from beautiful thoughts rather than being pumped with raw happiness."

It is truly a feeling like drifting off, like floating on a rippled surface of a lake and having a warm wind slowly gently push me out into deeper waters. It feels like there’s numbness in my fingertips. This feels very similar to LSD in terms of the come up and headspace, although it feels somewhat more dissociating, mentally and physically. There is also somewhat more body load, with a good bit of nausea setting in. Visuals are fairly abstract and lacking any sort of definitive form or pattern. Rather, they are concentric and rippled."

        "description": "This trips feels very ‘standard’ for a psychedelic experience. Thought is deeper, as in every bit of stimulus my mind encounters gets carefully handled and picked apart, dissected to have its internal depths plumbed and dredged and tinkered with. It’s like my mind is going the extra mile with regards to analyzing each designated “object”, and whatever associations that object generates. While this could certainly be considered a sort of mental enhancement, I realize that my mind’s ability to limit itself in this regard is functional and useful to keep me from constantly being awash in a daze of thought. This constant preoccupation with my own mind makes me feel awkward and stumbly in terms of my ability to outwardly interact with others and the world. Imagine a horse trying to run while staring intently at its feet.\n\nEventually my dear friend/old roommate comes over. I am now with two of my closest friends, we are hanging out and playing videogames. I watch my roommate play Kirby 64, It’s entertaining as hell and it’s pretty cool to see the visuals manifest on the screen. I feel like I am making a lot of really awkward and stupid comments that are attempting to come off as funny. I feel like I am just awkwardly and automatically saying and interjecting things to fill the silence, all of which go without response, the silence following each statement is deafening as my own voice echoes in my head. My friend talks about music he’s writing and recording and it’s so cool to hear how he engages with his passion and how this engagement interacts with his struggles with mental illness. He plays us a song and it’s so cool to listen to and this provides a substrate for me to talk about everything in substantially more fluid and less awkward manner. I still have some trouble articulating my thoughts, and it feels like I am treading carefully the line between profound statements and psychedelic burnout incoherency."

It’s scales seem to be rippling and breathing, and it’s so absurd that I’m holding an animal native to Australia in my North Philadelphia apartment. It runs around on the ground and I try to imagine what this creature must be thinking right now, in this strange world that defies all of its adaptations and instincts. We take it outside to the backyard to have it experience the world. I would say this was definitely my peak, at least in terms of sensory effects. Auditorily, things seem unaffected, people’s voices sound normal, albeit sort of isolated in a strange way, as if their voices are punctuated events in a grand void. Visually however, this was mindblowing. In the darkness, my entire field of vision is consumed by visuals. \n\nWhatever light there back here appears as shifting red, blue, green, magenta, and neon orange. Everything, literally everything is covered in swirling, pulsing, twisting and rippling concentric patterns, they are so prominent and clear that they begin to consume and obscure my vision. It should be noted that I am still fairly mentally lucid, I do not feel like my perception of such visual distortion represents a perception of a heavy disturbance in the fabric of reality. I am thinking clearly and rationally, it’s just that the world is becoming visually unrecognizable. After letting the lizard run about, we go back inside."

The sounds of people’s voices sounds so strange and surreal. It’s the sort of thing where I start to notice the properties of something while I’m tripping and it makes me wonder how I could ever take that thing for granted in a sober state. Of course this feeling never sticks or follows me into sobriety. My field of vision is still pulsing and flashing and the same sort of concentric patterns are still dancing on the walls, albeit somewhat fainter and weaker. I’m having fun though, I feel jovial and somewhat “burnt”, but I feel a lighthearted demeanor towards everything that makes it not bother me too much. I smoke some more weed.\n\nI have noticed that I do not really feel the “enhanced mind” effect that psychedelics give me on the comedown, where I feel more articulate and feel my thoughts flow faster. At this point, I still feel meek, dazed, and awkward. This is the sort of trip where it doesn’t bubble up in me and manifest in my mind, rather it’s the sort of trip that glistens and hover above my head, shining its glowering and glistening light down upon me."

I am certainly on the comedown now. We smoke some more and decide to go for a walk outside. It’s the first weekend of the school year and throngs of people are around town partying. My one friend is feeling very manic from the 3-MeO-PCP and wants to interact with everyone we walk by and run and play. I am extremely intimidated by everyone and want to keep to myself. Sometimes when coming down from psychedelics I am definitely in a sort of hypomanic state where I want to talk to everyone and I feel like I have something to say to everyone. However now, I feel like I cannot generate the appropriate words in any situation. I feel like I cannot even generate the appropriate thoughts.\n\nI feel meek and silenced and muzzled, I am awkward and afraid. I beseech him to stop trying to invite interaction from strangers. I am so very inhibited. We reach a grassy area between two dorm buildings and he does cartwheels on the lawn. I hide in a chair and try to artificially boost my confidence to stave off these effects. He eventually invites comments from people in the windows high above us, and honestly it’s a pretty silly and ridiculous situation. Eventually some of them come down and interact with us. Ideally I would have been able to converse smoothly and provide some sort of input, but I am in a sort of stunned silence, only able to utter awkward phrases. We eventually go to a grocery store and head home.\n\nI reflect on my lack of confidence. Part of it was the drug and its effects, however I feel like a strong part of all of this was also the fact that I was not presenting as I usually do, which can be intimidating or idiosyncratic to a certain degree. Appearing as my “normal” self made me feel weak and neutered. On the way home we meet up with some old friends in a restaurant and hang out there for a bit. In this setting I feel slightly more confident, like this muzzle is wearing off."

We all smoke some weed under the setting sun. Very pleasant and idyllic. The plants are just starting to come alive. I close my eyes and try to let myself sink into the mounting headspace. I am greeted by solid and angular geometry in bright colors, mirroring and bending. It feels like I am being vibrated apart, similar to MXP. It is like I am a string that is being plucked, only for the intensity of its vibrations to take it to pieces.\n\nOne distinctive open eyed visual came looking at the sky. I wove a web of twine over my backyard for vines to grow into some sort of canopy. There were eyespots in the middle of the spaces in the web, which was a pretty cool effect. I feel as though I am drifting out of touch with reality, where basic tasks and familiar images become unrecognizable and inconceivable. Every object we see has a semiotic designation in our minds, for example you see a car and think of the word “car”, and then all your thoughts and memories involving cars are triggered (at least that’s how it is for me). Here though, I see a car, and simply see an object in front of me, undefined and devoid of any meaning."

I just choose not to, it simply isn’t preferable in this mindset.\n\n\nI am playing music from my laptop, my roommate and my friend have a ukulele and small keyboard and are playing accompaniments to it. It is a warm euphoric space of camaraderie and pleasant bonding. I close my eyes and am awestruck with the intensity and complexity of the visual world that followed.\n\n\nThe first thing that manifests is a teal and magenta afterimage, a snapshot of the very last thing I saw before closing my eyes. This image lingers briefly, then begins to melt and deconstruct, warp and drag and blur until it is an unrecognizable mess of prismatic geometry. Suddenly it is all swept away by images of vast landscapes and realms. These images are reminiscent of the anatomy of invertebrates-tentacles and gelatinous protuberances, the repeated or branching forms of gills and filters and appendages, all in fluid pulsing motion, all in a spectacular array of rainbow or pastel colors. In some instances, there appears to be a vast polychrome city of soft and drooping forms, like towers of melted ice cream and putty.\n\nThe images begin to repeat and fractalize, until it is repeated in an infinite field before me, each manifestation of the image overlapping the others, like a vast screen of shingles or scales, each scale with an image on it. The entire field of repeated images begins to ripple and pulse."

Geometry forms into branches, rapidly replicating into fractal infinity, a beautiful representation of the recursion and replication inherent to all life forms. A great iridescent serpent slithers through a great pulsing rainbow landscape of mountains and hills. The hallucinatory visual field splits into segments, and it feels as though great segmented creatures are pulsing and thrashing against me. It feels like a rush, like cold water is pouring down my face. Everything in motion seems to leave behind 3 dimensional tracers, almost as if the “essence” or “soul” of all things in motion is trailing behind them, or perhaps it’s a representation of their kinetic energy when my vision is not bounded by linear time. This is present with both open and closed eyes. It feels like sounds are cushioning everything and outlining and encapsulating everything.\n\nMy laptop dies and I eagerly demonstrate that I can snap back into functionality by standing up, carrying it into the house, going upstairs and grabbing my charger, plugging it in, walking back outside, and plugging in the outdoor lights. I feel like I am melting and sinking when I sit still, but in motion I am acutely aware of my movement and momentum.

Yet it is still very lucid, and you can easily be basically functional if you need to (walking, talking etc).  Otherwise, it’s very warm and social, with a hint of empathogenic qualities, which is quite outstanding considering how emotionally dead dissociatives can be.\n\nSome of the sheer strangeness of the visual and headspace was reminiscent of DXM. Physically, it is neither stimulating nor sedating. It has a warm melting feeling with some of the rush that comes from MXE, which overall feels really nice. I’m not sure if it has inherent euphoria or whether I was just giddy over the absurdity and whimsy of the experience. Definitely one of my favorites. One thing to note- similar to psychedelics it has a fast and hard tolerance buildup, weakening the effects of all dissociatives for about a week after use. ",

        "description": "It’s still burgeoning and ballooning, I put a playlist of familiar music on shuffle as a reference point to fully analyze the alterations. The slide into this trip is gradual and continuous- it seems like every song sounds deeper than the last. Perhaps this is a perceptual illusion, like a Shepard’s tone, but what isn’t a perceptual illusion while tripping? Are the effects asymptotic? At what point will they level out? Only the passage of time will answer these questions. However just when I think I am following a predictable slide into the bubbling cauldron of effects, new perceptions begin to manifest.\n\nThere is slight warping at the edges of my vision, like viewing the world through a glass disc, curved around its rim. It is subtle but definitely noticeable. This was entirely absent with a lower dose.  \nSoon the auditory changes are not characterized only by a drop in tone, but also by a sense of bending and flanging and whirling and warping. It feels analogous to how the visual effects of psychedelics alter base visual perception- the ways in which my visual input would be altered have transposed themselves onto my auditory stimuli. Perhaps if I had more understanding of sound, tone, and music theory, I would be able to discern patterns and structures similar to the patterns and superstructures present in the visual perceptions of more standard psychedelics. To my mind however, it is simply a chaotic and esoteric shakedown of my sensory experience. The timbre of everything simply sounds “broken” for lack of any better description- it all feels so wrong, yet it is simply the experience I have subjected myself to, and I am content to accept that.\n\nThe body load sits atop the trip like a gargoyle, unpleasant but entirely manageable. The nausea is bubbling and tense, as if the churning of my stomach has a magnetic energy that pulls my muscles inwards towards it, taut and unnerving."

I would describe the progression of effects as being certainly asymptotic. My auditory input is adorned with further hallucinatory effects- Now there are odd off kilter harmonies sliding up alongside everything – as if every sound has a duplicate that is shifted slightly out of phase, turning the world into a beautiful cacophony of discordant tones, yet this is not unpleasant in the least, it is mostly fascinating.\n\nThe last time I did this, I found the novelty of the experience exhilarating. I felt elated and euphoric and wanted to communicate this enthusiasm with everybody I knew, as if the drug had an empathogenic effect. This time around however, the novelty has worn off and the experience is very matter of fact- merely existing before me. Perhaps all of the euphoria, the excitement, the sociability from last time was just a result of being enthralled at the novelty of the experience. I am decidedly content with the experience I am having now but am not feeling much beyond that.\n\nCognitively I am still largely functional, typing the same, existing the same, I could probably pass for sober in most contexts were I not so weirded out and distracted by the alterations to sound."

I notice that my drawing ability doesn't feel altered in any way- none of the flowing traceries and patterns and repetitive or radiating or exponential forms that I typically draw while on psychedelics.  While listening to more music I notice the flanging effect is less noted through headphones than through speakers, as if the distance the sound travels through the air gives it a greater capacity for the drug to wrangle it and bend it out of shape. Another odd effect is music with voices that have been pitched up now sound completely normal- this shouldn’t be surprising or interesting in the least, it was entirely expected, but it was interesting to observe. Aside from that, sounds still are tinny and have an odd ring to them."

Watching videos of people and hearing their voices in a non-musical context provides for a new interesting stimulus. Every voice of course sounds lower, but is also accompanied by an odd low buzzing, like a speaker clipping. It’s as if there is a fuzzy distortion oozing off of every sound and pooling at their feet, a jumble of artifacts and noise."

It’s a curious experience but so far hasn’t proven to be much beyond that.",

    "introduction": "Deschloroketamine is a new arylcyclohexamine on the scene (already reportedly being sold as normal ketamine in the UK...), and it's a blast, I'd be stoked if someone gave me this instead of K. Nomenclature is weird. DXE has been thrown around but that's just to market it  to be like MXE, that name makes absolutely no sense. DCK would be the most proper abbreviation but like... DCK hehehhe lololol sorry I'm like 12. It is the ketamine molecule (a derivative of PCM (phenyl-cyclohexane-N-Methyl), minus a chlorine. MXE gets the E in its abbreviation from being a PCE analogue, the E indicates an N-Ethyl group. The X in MXE designates the 3-Methoxy group. There is no N-Ethyl or methoxy group in this one. DXE is about as wrong a name as you could give it. DCM is one I think is proper but it hasn't caught on, i doubt itll catch on, and no one will recognize it. I'll just call it desket for short. But i digress.......\nI took live notes during this one. They are incoherent. You can read them here:\nhttp://pastebin.com/skHnA3uS\nI tried to incorporate them into the report as best I could but a good chunk of them I just don't remember and a lot of it just isn't even words.",

Timestamps cannot exist for the next bit of time.\n\nIndependent movement quickly becomes a foreign concept as I am rendered more or less catatonic. This is the warmest and most pleasant drug induced paralysis I’ve ever felt, it feels like a great warm blanket has been draped over me, immensely heavy but not so much as to crush me. There is no reason I would want to move, I have been rendered statuary, both physically and psychologically. This is a big dissociative hug.\n\nI have my laptop on my lap. I decide I will try to type out live notes of my CEV scapes. I find myself able to operate my fingers at the very least, but it is extremely difficult. If I am not looking at them I completely lose track of where they are, and I find my sense of which hand is left/right crossed many many many times. I’ve fallen into a dissociative “hole” state, and this is pretty cool. This hole is nothing like vast empty expanse of the K hole, but rather is strikingly similar to MXE. It has the same deep intense reds, greens, and blues acting as auras and a general color palette for this internal world. Similarly to the MXE hole, it is an experience of mentally generated surreal worlds and scenarios, all appropriately abstract and highly incomprehensible. These aren’t the coherent disturbing alternate realities of DXM, simply dreamlike amalgamations borrowing elements from my conscious world. My notes are unfortunately irredeemably incoherent at points, but I do recall the feeling of being sprayed in the face with a great numbing hose, or lying in a raging river and having the rushing water swirl around me and take my form away.\n\nOne visual I remember is the entire world flattening into ribbons that slid past one another, each adorned with many blurred violet human silhouettes. It was as if they were film strips containing a million soulless bodily forms. The other close eyed visuals came in the form of biomorphic hallucinations, mostly imitating animals that I have an affinity for. Images of insects, isopods, stingrays, and millipedes paraded around my exploding mind, all of them being bent and warped in impossible ways to fit the strange constraints of esoteric patterns that lurked beneath this rippled reality. I feel like I am being washed over by a raging storm, and it feels great, it feels awesome. It’s raging benevolence. It’s a tsunami and a hurricane that simply want to give me a hug. It feels like raging winds are blowing away the dust of my corporeal form. I try to write these images, but I am forced to open my eyes every time I want to type. I keep losing track of my fingers, and they keep losing track of one another.\n\nWaves are a recurring feeling, ocean waves, washing over me. Each time they wash over me, my form melts and coalesces to fit the form of the surface of this nonexistent sea. My entire existence is on a plane that is undulating and splashing about. This feels immensely and irresistibly cozy. I feel like I have built a psychological fortress, I have made a castle of soft numbing bricks, this is my safe place, this is the realm where I have dominion, over an imaginary world, but most importantly, dominion over myself that I do not feel in my sober life. I spend a great deal of time hallucinating vivid dream scenarios. I ditch my anesthetized body and explore the caverns of my mind. In the included notes there is some vague attempt at mentioning many of these dream sequences. Honestly though, a great deal of those notes are incoherent and I have literally 0 memory of them, so I will just leave them be for now. There was a great deal of scenario/setting shifting however, teleporting me around the city and taking me to all variety of strange fractal castles. This feels like a grand carnival, a celebration of my imagination, I am inside a great hexagon, and a billion geometric forms strive to converge on me. Surreal looking creatures parade around the rim of my polyhedral world, this is an orgiastic and slovenly display of ego and rather than ego loss, it seems to be an ego transplantation, it is moving the ego to a place where it is boundless and powerful to its own discretion."

I talk people’s heads off, the afterglow is typical of any dissociative afterglow, but I am thankfully spared the short term memory loss.\n\nThis stuff is great. New favorite drug mayhaps, it is a beautiful colorful adventure space like MXE, where I can to a degree create a world of my own design. This is what I’ve been pursuing through psychonautics all this time, this is what I’ve pursued my entire life. I feel like with more trials and more focused meditation I can totally control this to an omnipotent degree. Flashes of narcissism ;)",

How I felt I was living a lie to everyone I met, wearing a different mask depending on who I talked to. Faking everything until I made it work.\n\nI couldn’t comprehend who I was supposed to be, or who I had become. How I had crafted this persona and person to be around people, and fit myself into that shape. I couldn’t comprehend and didn’t want to understand that I had to get a job again, pay rent and just live until I died. Didn’t want to keep on working just so I could live and then die, I’d rather skip right to the last step.\n\nThe reality of how I interacted with other people and who saw me as what, was entirely slapping me. I felt like no matter who knew me, they all got some variation of the same lie. I had just built a character and lived in a simulation, in the moment, trying to come up with my own role.\n\nI had constructed this character out of lies and felt like everything about me was a lie. I didn’t want to accept that I had to just go and live as this person I had made. I hated the idea of living as someone, and working until I died. I wanted to throw the concepts of relationships and other people out the window, throw out the concept of enjoyment, skip straight to the last step and die.\n\nI’d been keeping everything on the backburner, putting everything off until later, until I fucked around and found out, until whatever it was I had put off caught up to me. I understood it wasn’t sustainable, but this is how I had lived up until now. I’d built a life and character where I procrastinated everything until it was too late to change. I had been living in the moment for so long with so much always on the backburner that I had never given myself a chance to plan ahead.\n\nI couldn’t seem to find a reason to keep going, keep on living, no matter the person who I was or who I could craft. I didn’t want to become this person I had constructed. I didn’t know what I wanted out of life, and didn’t want to accept that I just had to keep on living. I didn’t know where to go from here, and didn’t believe I was really playing the person I was. I didn’t want to accept that this is what I had been given, and who I had made.\n\nI felt like I had crafted this person out of lies and didn’t see a reason to keep going, pushing up a mountain. I didn’t want to keep going, and was heavily contemplating suicide. Envisioning driving a knife into my chest, letting the people in my life continue living their stories without me. I wanted out, out of this life I had made, but I also didn’t want to be someone else’s burden, someone else’s body, to take care of. I felt completely worthless, and insignificant spec in the world with no reason to go on. Everyone who knew me, knew me as some version of a lie, so why should their relationship matter to me if they didn’t know me?\n\nI’d built this persona and decided to live in it, and refused to accept that. I wished it could be as simple as being a frog and sitting on a leaf for the rest of my life, with nothing else to worry about. No hidden anxiety that I masked on a daily basis, put off for later. No burdens or promises or words. No procrastinating or thinking, or figuring out my life as I went along instead of ahead of time."

Trying to make plans for the future to process and work on what I thought needed to be changed. Hopefully come up with a more concrete idea of what I want out of life, and stop putting everything off until later. This was the first actually challenging trip I've had, and forced me to think a lot about myself, and I feel it's significantly changed the paths I take in the future. ",

Interestingly, it seemed to bring back the MXiPr high a little bit, and it felt like it ‘salvaged’ the experience, at least partially. Light from the Sun suddenly pouring into the room undoubtedly helped too. Encouraged, I tried inhaling three cartridges back to back, and while it was one of the most intense nitrous experiences that I ever got (I have prior experience with 4-5 cartridges), it felt like it potentiated the MXiPr only very weakly, which is strange. There is marked amnesia about the nitrous experience, and now as I am writing these words, I am actually not sure about the specifics of it. I remember thinking something like ‘lungs are your way of reproducing with the world’ or something, possibly triggered by some strange feeling when inhaling the gas, and I remember that the music sounded very distorted and somewhat ‘geometric’, whatever that means, but that’s about it.\nI considered redosing MXiPr, but ultimately decided against it, at least for now.

The feelings of guilt over avoiding responsibility that I had seem clearly overblown from the sober point of view, so it’s kind of strange to think that there was some unresolved guilt beneath the surface that manifested during the experience, though not impossible.\n\nNow (14. 8. 2021), as I am transcribing this report a few months after this experience, I am eager to try MXiPr again in the future. Clearly the substance has a lot of good to offer. I heard from multiple other psychonauts that the oral administration tends to lead to worse experiences than the intranasal route, so I will probably experience with it intranasally the next time I feel like taking a serotonergic dissociative.",

    "introduction": "Continuous daily use of Sertraline (50mg, orally) and piracetam (1200mg, orally) for a few previous months, stopping three days before this voyage takes place.\n\nThe fumarate salt of 4-Pro-DMT was obtained from a trusted vendor, untested; optically it is fine brown powder of a shade reminiscent of that of chocolate; consumed a week or so after it arrived, stored at room temperature in the meantime. \n\nDose was weighted out using a milligram scale.\n\nThere is some confusion online about what does 4-Pro-DMT mean - some claim that 4-Pro is 4-propionyl, others that it is 4-propoxy. The substance that I used and which I am describing in this report is the 4-propionyl variant - I elect to call it 4-Pro-DMT, since the 4-propoxy variant should be called 4-PrO-DMT (given that methoxy and ethoxy are MeO and EtO respectively, both with capital O).\n\nPrevious experience with the compound: I tried 4-Pro-DMT once before using a threshold dose (5mg). I have extensive previous experience with psychedelics in general, including several compounds that should be close to 4-Pro-DMT (assuming it's also metabolised into psilocin) - 4-AcO-DMT and psilocybin and psilocin itself in magic mushrooms.\n\nSet: I am feeling well, excited to test what a compound will do when I take it and then go back to sleep before the effects take place. Very slight anxiety, which I usually get when trying psychedelics. Mild lower abdomen pain which later turned out to be most likely psychosomatic.\n\nSetting: In my room, at home, and later in a calm city park. It was roughly 5 degrees Celsius outside in a sudden upswing of temperature after a few weeks of freezing winter. Snow melted and the park’s ground was wet and muddy. The atmosphere was almost as if during an autumn, though it’s closer to spring by now.\n\nOther: The plan was to take the compound and then go back to sleep, letting the effects wake me up.",

First, I started to feel a very slight body high, the typical pleasant psychedelic tingling over most of the body. It had a strange aspect to it, though – on the backs of my hands, I felt a sensation of cold, except it felt strangely neutral or even pleasant. This experience made me quite excited, because I haven’t really experienced something like this so early into a low dose before.\n\tGradually, closed eye visuals started to appear. It was extremely soft, and began with the natural chaotic ‘buzzing’ of black-to-brown noise that one gets when they close their eyes in the dark becoming softly ‘crystallic’, as if the noise were slowly coalescing into more meaningful shapes. The body high grew stronger, though in character it remained the same. I also got the typical psychedelic feeling around the gums of my teeth, which is really hard to describe other than ‘increased sensitivity and a sense of very very soft pins and needles’.\n"

At one point there were marked proprioceptive hallucinations, I felt as if I had arms extending to the sides of my body (my actual arms were resting on it), and that I had more of them than usual. This felt pleasant and amused me greatly. Sense of humour in general seems to be enhanced, and I am in a really good mood. \nMuch more pronounced closed eye visual, biotic and geometric in nature. At one point, I saw a vaguely menacing piece of geometry that extended a long, protruding piece of itself ‘into’ me. Rather than fight it, which is what I would usually do, I opened myself to it, let all the shields down. Nothing bad happened, and in general I felt just as good as before, and in good humors.\nGood, though not excellent, erotica. I wish I had someone to cuddle with around, and considered calling a past love that I am still strongly intimate with, but ultimately decided against it, because she probably has an online lecture right about now, or is sleeping.\nThoughts about my gender identity and sexual orientation also surfaced. I concluded that I feel more genderfluid and bisexual while on psychedelics, and that I feel hermaphroditic more than anything else – I wish I could have all of the organs (and probably also looked more feminine, though I am not entirely sure about that).\nGetting up and walking around the flat a little bit, I discovered that I am higher than I thought. Marked acuity enhancement and some colour enhancement.  Things seem to be, hm, more ‘ontologically present’, as if they were more pronounced and recognizable as things, and more distinct from each other than normally – this felt pronounced with a large house plant near a window, and especially pronounced with a belt randomly resting on the sofa’s back support. \nThe psychedelic varnish over the world, so to speak, is very much present indeed, though subjectively it felt that I weren't that high - that might however change were I to interact with people more, though after talking with my brother, this assessment still feels correct. I am definitely able to hold a conversation about our company’s business, though I have to focus much more than normally on what I am saying."

Walking to the park through the streets, it felt like there were hints of textures of the roads and other everyday objects around becoming ‘cartoonish’ – not that they would actually seem that way, but it felt that had I taken a higher dose, this is the direction the visuals might take. Also on the way to the park, I noticed that people seemed unattractive to me, though this might have been simply due to randomly meeting only unattractive people (but even attractive people seeming unattractive is a relatively common psychedelic effect for me).\nThe city park that I went to was beautiful despite its muddy fall-like appearance (we got a sudden heatwave after a few weeks of strongly cold weather). The state feels subtly energetic in a way which invites activities like hugging trees and accidentally putting one’s foot through thin ice of a lake into the water.\nVisual acuity enhancement and depth perception enhancement. Textures and colours, especially those of tree barks, greatly enhanced. The park used to be one huge lake, so it has the shape of a large oval with a central area which is depressed by seven or so meters compared to the sides, which used to be its shores. The area is dotted with multiple rather large lakes, and now seemed extremely spacious, as if I were extraordinarily aware of how huge it in fact is (it has like six hundred meters across).\nWatching one of my favourite trees in the park, a large white oak, it first felt strange, as if it gained a shape different than normally (though it’s equally possible that only now I noticed the shape in full), and then majestic in a almost religious way, and reminded me of the weirwoods in Game of Thrones.\n\tMuch to my surprise, when I was returning from the park, moving my hands in front of my eyes resulted in weak though still clearly present tracers. Despite the weather being quite cold (around 3-4 degrees Celsius), and me wearing only a t-shirt with short sleeves, a sweater, a relatively light jacket, a wool cap, and casual jeans with tennis shoes, I felt very warm to the point that I took my cap off (and when I returned home, I also took my shirt off). This made me suspicious of possible serotonergic influence on body temperature, so I measured it at 11:08 (T + 03:51; while already home for quarter an hour or so) and found out that it was 35.9C, which is an ordinary temperature for me.\n\tSubjectively though, even while sitting behind the computer and writing these words, I do feel warm. I am not entirely sure if I would compare it to empathogenic warmth… it feels similar to being snuggled in a bed under a warm blanket, except I am sitting half-naked on a chair instead.\n"

Upon touch, it feels just about the way one would assume an oil would. It smells somewhere between a hospital disinfectant/hydrogen peroxide and a pine tree, with the balance being far tilted in the direction of the disinfectant/peroxide. Not what I expected.\n\nThere is around 15g/18ml of a-Pinene in the tiny bottle that I am using. Given that my target dose is 40mg (which was the dose that Josikinz said made her pretty high), I will draw 0.05ml of the oil with a syringe and deposit it under my tongue.\n\nPrevious experience with the compound: None. This is my first experiment with it. I have no experience with other supposedly psychoactive essential oils either.\n\nSet: A little anxiety over whether the product that we got is pure – it seems irrational, there is no reason to assume it isn’t, but stuff like this is impossible to test without professional chemical equipment, and I always get nervous when experimenting with a new substance, especially one with almost no known reports of prior human use.\n\nSetting: At home, in my room, sometimes accompanied by my youngest brother (he’s 18).\n",

Focusing on the stopwatch while counting was sort of strange, and made me unsure whether I am experiencing time flow slightly slower or faster than normal, but then I realized it’s probably just somewhat harder for me to focus properly on it.

Ayahuasca was having none of it, and I didn’t want to force myself upon her and end the trip early or shame myself, so I ceased. I opened my eyes, looked around the room, and went back under the jumper. The second hallucination.\n\nI was looking into the dirty, messy living room of a house I had never seen before, and saw an overweight humanoid in a baseball cap and ill-fitting t-shirt watching TV on an armchair. This was another personification of Ayahuasca, but this one was male. Everything in this hallucination was made of different shades of blue, including Ayahuasca. I realised this was Ayahuasca, “So you’re a dude! Sorry about earlier, I always thought of you as a sexy female temptress” I thought/said. He seemed cool about the whole mix-up. It turned out he was an overweight teenager, and was a massive stoner. He proceeded to take my hand and show me where he lived, so we flew in the sky like Superman above his house. The house was atop a huge cliff that was perfectly smooth and semi-circular. Beneath the front garden was a sheer drop thousands of miles deep, which looked like an endless abyss. Ayahuasca told me he likes to trip and stare into the abyss to see the visuals.\n\nThe third hallucination, including the build-up.\n\nFor some reason the stoner Ayahuasca hallucination stopped, so I went upstairs where my friend Josikins tested her strobe light on me; eyes closed but with my face close to the strobe light, for a few flashes there were geometric, wire-y visuals, but they ended quickly and it was just a strobe light again. We went into the bathroom together, as it had no windows and was the darkest room in the house, kept the lights off and chatted for a bit. I told her about my hallucination, and she was telling me something (but I can’t remember what), and then left. Only a few seconds passed with me in total darkness and utter silence, but I started hearing music (it sounded very similar to the first 45 seconds of ‘No Quarter’ by Led Zeppelin), and I was lifted out of my body – utterly DMT-like! This hallucination, however brief, was the most vivid and real one I have ever experienced (and I was once convinced that I was a medical book with a few pages missing when I had a fever once). The content wasn’t constructed out of visuals, everything looked perfectly real. I was in the sky, among the clouds, jumping fantastically high and for long distances, using rogue clouds as stepping stones. In the distance was an enormous castle which looked very similar in structure to the one you see in the beginning of Disney credits, only this one was made of crystal and was refracting/deflecting light like a prism, which covered the castle in a flowing rainbow. It was beautiful. I jumped over a few more clouds, trying to make it to the castle, but missed one and fell. I was among lower clouds, covering the sky like a blanket, and I was slowly sinking beneath them. I had one hand outstretched, trying to reach the castle, and I saw dozens of other hands doing the same thing around me. I was eventually submerged beneath the clouds, and that was me back in the bathroom in the dark, smiling insanely. "

Once this had been done we headed upstairs and made ourselves comfortable in a darkened room on the bed.\n\nI compiled a short musical playlist for my trip which was comprised of Friction and Mt Eden which I intended to listen to through my head phones during the experience.\n\nOnce this was done, Josikins began to light the DMT mix for me and I started to rip the bong. After taking a few hits from the bong, my visual field suddenly became extremely altered. It appeared as if I was looking through a psychedelic kaleidoscope spiral of repeating shards of inconsistently shapes triangles. These shapes did not contain colors but a continuously repeated image of my vision."

I had no knowledge of self or even physical being. All that existed was the music and the most amazing level 6 geometry comprised of intricate patterns with thousands of brilliant hues and shades that fluctuated and pulsed to the beat. This continued for several minutes until I slowly started to regain physical feeling. I realized that I felt slightly damp, then suddenly it felt like gravity was pulling me down, as I started falling into the position which I awoke from above.\n\nI sat up at the edge of the bed and opened my eyes, distortions such as visual drifting along with geometric patterns still covered my whole field of vision. I then found that the damp feeling was due to the bong being spilt slightly on me while I was tripping but I hadn't felt it until I began to reconnect with my body."

        "description": "My Second DMT trip. It felt like I was on rails the whole time, and first of all I entered a dodecahedron cavern made of bright visuals, ever-repeating itself, like a wallpaper but it was covering everything, including the moving parts and beings of the trip. It looked a little like the ‘eye’ of a peacock’s tail; bright pink, bright blue, and the filler was yellow.\n\nIn the centre of the dodecahedron was a single stalactite, which melted into the floor, like sand in an hourglass. Then the cave started to morph, and became a giant lady looming above me, dancing something like the Can-Can, waving her skirt around her hips like they do, and her skirt obscured her face (all entirely made of the same visuals). After the cave morphed into the lady, I started moving sideways (to my right), automatically. The lady became a gentleman (a giant once more); suited and carrying a briefcase, though because he was walking past me his briefcase obscured my entire field of vision and so I didn’t see his face either. I then began to move slowly backwards. I knew that this meant I was past the peak of my trip, so I had to make the most of my time there. It was like I was standing on a platform in outer space, and in front of me were the visuals jumping up and down, looking like multi-colored television static. I asked the dancing shapes (without using my real voice) “This is lovely, how do we (humans) find you?” The shapes became flat, and I could see shapes among this enormous 3D plane resembling jets, like jet propulsion (so maybe this meant fly to another planet?). Each time the visuals made a shape, they went back to looking like static after about 1 second. I then asked “How do we get here?”, and the plain changed into endless mounds of countless human skulls (still multi-colored, and they didn’t seem sinister), which I took to mean ‘all of mankind will see this when they die’. I finally asked “What happens to us (mankind)?”, and the static changed into clouds and thrashing rain (which I thought meant a storm-based/water-based natural disaster as opposed to just lots of rain).\n\nI was continuing going backwards, and then saw that I had passed through a gateway, then the gate shut in front of me. I was travelling backwards into a cell, and though that I would end up in an upright coffin. I thought that was a bit sinister, but then to reassure me the DMT produced an entity in the shape of a Victorian nanny, who picked me up (I was looking at myself from the 3rd person for this), and kissed me on my forehead and placed me into a cot like a baby. This was very reassuring. When I was lying down in the coffin I was back in the room.\n\nAs I was in total silence for this trip (having previously tripped while listening to Shpongle), I had some audio hallucinations; there was music that largely sounded like whale song but was deeper-sounding/more bass-y, but it was interspersed with pops like the kind you hear underwater."

    "introduction": "Today was the most intense day of my life. It was the greatest and most beautiful experience I have ever had. I was so happy I cried many times. I have never felt so at peace. I have never felt so happy. I have never felt so small and big at the same time. LSD feels like a giant contradiction. It feels like yin and yang.\n\nToday I had my second experience with LSD. I took around 300 μg of LSD at 9 AM this morning. The LSD was tested using Ehrlich's reagent test and obtained from a reliable seller. Last week, I had tested 150μg with underwhelming results. I was ready for an intense trip this time. I have tripped on shrooms/4-aco-dmt at least 15 times now and am fairly comfortable with psychedelic effects.\n\nDuring my trip, I felt like I had 1000x more control of my body and mind than I do sober. I could have multiple streams of thought / conversations going on at the same time and there was no confusion. At least five commentaries were going on at all times during my entire trip (except during the peaks where crazier shit was happening). These commentaries changed based on environmental factors. It felt as though \"the LSD\" had a fantastic sense of humor. It made complex and complicated jokes for me. It cracked me up. I was so amused and impressed at the cleverness and power of this drug.\n\nSo many incredible thoughts and feelings happened during the trip, but I can't translate them into English. This trip report contains less than 5% of what I experienced. The trip lasted for twelve hours and I was having trippy/intense thoughts and feelings constantly throughout. Many moments felt timeless simply because I was experiencing so much so fast. I felt feelings that I have never felt before. I'm cannot yet describe what happened in English, but I imagine it will get easier with time. In this report, I am just going to describe what I can remember of the most important events.\n\nI am not even going to attempt to describe the visuals -- you can view them on the blog I linked you. I don't really pay much attention to the visuals while I am tripping. I pay much more attention to the mental effects, though I do enjoy the visuals and find that they add something special to the experience.\n\nAfter putting the two tabs under my tongue, I cleaned my room until I felt like I could no longer ignore the effects. The come up was very fast and caused no nausea unlike mushrooms. I decide to take a shower because I love peaking while in a relaxing setting. I felt a complete lack of anxiety by this point which lasted throughout the entire trip. I decide I want to try to go as far as I can go so I smoke sativa hash oil (always intensifies the trip for me and causes me to peak quicker). I write:",

        "description": "This is the most intense part and I hardly remember any of it! It felt like something crazy was going to happen and the LSD was slowly easing me into this so I would be as comfortable as possible. I started peaking in the shower. My thoughts got crazy and then everything got so intense that I had to sit down. I had close eye visuals of visually impossible patterns or optical illusions. Everything felt so fucking trippy and I was loving every second of it. My thoughts start heading towards ego death. I start having regrets, thinking I am not so sure I am ready after all, but then I realize this is something that no human being can ever be ready for and I decide it’s now or never and I realize I have never been more ready in my life.\n\nI begin to go into different trances where I am given knowledge that is felt as a “truth.” After I come down from the trances, I am only able to remember specific keywords. As the experience is not translatable to English, I can only try my best. Here is what happened: I feel like time has stopped completely. I let the hot water rain onto my face while sitting down in the shower and tried to relax and let my ego die but it was such a strange feeling. This was the only point I ever felt overwhelmed during the trip as I didn’t know how far I was going to go at this point, but it was only for a split second. My face hits the hottest part of the shower water and the sudden heat reminds me of the idea of hell. I hesitate as I catch a glimpse into what I imagine ego death to be. I can no longer feel my body and I feel like I’m starting to fall straight into hell and I am aware that this drug could bring me to hell as it has brought others to hell and it would be more real and longer lasting than anything I have ever experienced sober. But then I realize that ego death means the end of myself which means there can be no fear. And then I’m not scared of death at all anymore and realize I never would be again and I try to let go. I remember thinking “would I be so scared of ego death if the overwhelming feeling I feel right now was replaced with feelings of peace and happiness?” I decided that I wouldn’t be scared at all so I stopped being afraid. The fact that I hesitated for a second, but decided to attempt ego death anyway, was very important part of the trip.\n\nI am back with my body at this point, but I still want ego death. Everything is a bit confusing, but I have a feeling that I will have more control next time. So I sit and close my eyes and attempt to switch points of view with a random drop of shower water just to see if that could send me into ego death. Something weird/hilarious happens when I try to do this and I start cracking up. And then it felt like I died and was born and my birth was the beginning of the universe and then I got another glimpse into complete ego death (sorry, I can’t describe this yet, I barely remember and I can only remember specific keywords!! I’ll try to describe it better next time). It was a completely different level and it was so intense that I hesitated again. I begin to enter into some kind of dreamlike vision that is a total different level of tripping than I am used to. I was going to BECOME the vision. I had no body. The vision starts out in ancient Egypt. I was so certain at the time that it was Egypt! I felt like I was beginning to live the life of an Egyptian girl from the past, but it was only for a split second then I am brought back into my physical body. I felt that by starting to show me this, lsd was trying to teach me a lesson or tell me a mystical, religious, or spiritual story. It was a feature of the lsd. I got the feeling that the vision was going to be about how religion came about, but I have no proof of this as I never finished or even began the vision because I hesitated for a second time when I stopped feeling my body. Because I hesitated, I was not able to go any farther into the vision.\n\nI experienced another delusional “truth” that either because I hesitated twice when I tried to go into complete ego death or because of random chance or both, I was going to chase after ego death the entire trip and never reach it but I had to try anyways (so much more complicated than this though). This was an extremely euphoric moment and I didn’t mind that I had to chase ego death as I was still having a fantastic trip already and the intensity level was perfect. I had to chase after ego death so that I knew that I really wanted ego death so that I could go deeper.\n\nAfter I stop peaking, I get out of the shower and go back to my room to get dressed. I decide to take a walk on State Street while I wait for my next peak. I had extremely profound thoughts and the removal of the cultural filter. I can’t even begin to explain what I felt or thought, but it was the greatest walk of my life. I never feel confused on acid like I sometimes do on shrooms. With mushrooms, you are the passenger, but with LSD you are the driver.\n\nWhile walking down State Street I felt like I was an alien learning how to be human again. I felt like an alien being welcomed into a strange new land and then I realized that this land was not so alien after all! It was built just for me! And I had created it! It was all mine! I was so happy!\n\nAfter walking down State Street a few times, I have a delusion that today is the day that either I die and am reborn or I almost die and am almost reborn but miss it. I realize that I am starting to peak upwards again and decide to head to my house to peak in the shower and attempt to kill my ego again to prove to myself that this is what I want.\n\n(I didn’t realize that both delusional truth scenarios had ALREADY happened until my ego started coming back after the third peak haaha! I love lsd. )"

I was in the shower and I attempted ego death again just because I felt like I had to go in a loop “outside, shower, outside, shower, outside, shower” and repeat it throughout the trip just to prove to myself that I really wanted ego death. It felt like this was the way the trip was supposed to go because I was chasing ego death but had missed my chance because I hesitated twice. It was not a negative loop or anything, just a loop I decided to go with because it amused me and I knew that LSD loves loops. I close my eyes, meditate, and attempt to breakthrough to the other side of ego death and nothing happens, but I am so fucking proud of myself for attempting.\n\nI get out of the shower, get dressed, and go outside and listen to music. I had a fantastic walk on State Street. When I feel myself peaking upwards again, I head to my house. I see one of my extroverted housemates Staci and converse with her for a minute instead of ignoring her like I would have sober. I don’t want to make conversation for long though as she starts getting depressing so I just tell her that I’m peaking on acid and need to lie down or get in the shower and she wishes me a good trip.\n\nSo I go back into the shower, attempting ego death again. I close my eyes, sit down, and try to meditate, but I realize that I’m not going to get anywhere. This doesn’t bother me at all, as I experience a delusional “truth” that me going back to ego death during this trip was a very rare possibility as I had missed my chance when I had hesitated twice during my first peak but it was also because of random chance and math that had already been calculated. I had known this from the very start of the trip as a “truth” yet I still felt like I had to at least attempt ego death as to go along with the way the trip was supposed to happen.\n\nA few minutes pass. I assume the third peak is finished as I can feel myself coming down. I admit defeat – ego death was not going to happen today. I missed my chance at ego death this trip because I hesitated twice, but, I am still completely satisfied with the trip intensity and so proud of myself for attempting anyways! I get out of the shower and start walking towards my room.\n\nWhile on my way to my room, I realize that I had forgotten to brush my teeth. I head back into the shower to brush them. And then LSD surprises THE ABSOLUTE FUCK OUT OF ME. As soon as I step back into the shower I start PEAKING ABSOLUTE BALLS. It was FUCKING RIDICULOUS because I was simply not expecting it at all. I thought I had already gone through the third peak and was coming down now. I thought my trip had ended. I had admitted defeat, already admitted to myself that ego death was simply not going to happen this trip – I had had my chance and had hesitated twice and I would have to try again next time I dosed and that was perfectly alright with me. I was just trying to brush my teeth!"

        "description": "This was the happiest moment of my life. To quote Disregard Everything I Say, *“the feelings of profundity become so intense and profound that it becomes manifested as the feeling that you’re entire life has been building up to this single point and that the present moment has historical significance for all of humanity as nothing will ever be the same again.”* I felt this exactly. I go into a “truth” where I discover that LSD and other psychedelics are “internally embedded, chemically induced religions that have existed within human beings all along”. At some points, it felt like LSD was a gift from some higher power - god, some programmer, myself, and/or all of the above. At other points, it felt like evolution was completely responsible for this. I experienced multiple points of view and could look at LSD from many different angles. This “truth” EXCITED THE FUCK OUT OF ME. I WAS GEEKING THE FUCK OUT COMPLETELY. I was like “holy shit holy shit holy shit oh my fucking god asfsfsfasdfas” the entire time. I thought of Shulgin and Hoffman at some points. I came to the conclusion that psychedelics have made a much bigger impact on human society, history, and religion than I had ever thought possible. Humans have been tripping balls for centuries and it is only nowadays that this is frowned upon by society. This peak was the most euphoric and happiest part of the entire trip. It felt like the “grand finale” of the trip. I clapped when the LSD was done showing off. I also remember bursting into tears of relief and happiness at some points of the peak. So intense. Looking back, I felt EXACTLY like this paragraph by Alexander Shulgin in Pihkal:\n\n*“I am completely convinced that there is a wealth of information built into us, with miles of intuitive knowledge tucked away in the genetic material of every one of our cells. Something akin to a library containing uncountable reference volumes, but without some means of access, there is no way to even begin to guess at the extent of quality of what is there. The psychedelic drugs allow exploration of this interior world, and insights into its nature. Our generation is the first ever to have made the search for self-awareness a crime, if it is done with the use of plants or chemical compounds as the means of opening the psychic doors. But the urge to become aware is always present, and it increases in intensity as one grows older. This is the search that has been a part of human life from the very first moments of consciousness. The knowledge of his own mortality, knowledge which places him apart from his fellow animals, is what gives Man the right, the license, to explore the nature of his own soul and spirit, to discover what he can about the components of the human psyche. How is it then, that the leaders of our society have seen fit to try to eliminate this one very important means of learning and self-discovery, this means which has been used, respected, and honored for thousands of years, in every human culture of which we have a record? Why has peyote, for instance, which has served for centuries as a means by which a person may open his soul to an experience of God, been classified by our government as a Schedule I material, along with cocaine, heroin, and PCP? … Part of the answer may lie in an increasing trend in our culture towards both paternalism (authorities supply need and thus are able to dictate conduct) and provincialism (a narrowness of outlook, a single code of ethics)… The government and the Church decided that psychedelic drugs were dangerous to society and with the help of the press, it was made clear that this was the way to social chaos and spiritual disaster. What was unstated, of course, was the oldest rule of all: Thou shalt not oppose nor embarrass those in power without being punished.”*\n\nAfter the peak is over, I head out of the shower and back into my room. I am still tripping out hardcore about what just happened to me. I try to communicate what just happened in human English. I manage to type this:\n\n\"*OH MY FUCKING GOD WHY THE FUCK IS THERE A SOME KIUDDRELIGIOUS KEY (LSD) IN OURSELVES? Why the fuc is theresomeweirfd religious/spirtuiual keyin side LSD>??? 2:13\"*\n\nThis took a ridiculous time to type out and I had to hit the backspace button multiple times. It felt like my fingers were too big for the keyboard buttons. The words written on the screen didn’t look English. I didn’t know how to form sentences. I didn’t know what words go before others so I just tried to get them all on there, but soon I realized it was pointless. I can’t translate what had happened to me. I had gotten the keywords down, that would be enough. I finally grasped the importance of time stamps, but still don’t know what time actually was. I’m geeking out and can’t stop pacing around my room with rapid cycling thoughts. Fifteen minutes later, I finally have my thoughts together and type:\n\n*2:34 PM things make more sense but I still don’t know why there is a religious key inside of us, quote from pihkal*"

        "description": "At this point, I am five or six hours into my trip. My mind has never felt this clear. I felt more sober than sober. I had knowledge of all things. I still had my long-term memory, but it was pointless to think of anything stored in my long-term memory because I was having the most profound thoughts of my life. I can’t even describe them… because the thoughts were lost after I transitioned from feeling everything to being human.\n\nI go outside. And then it hit me as a “truth” that the first five hours of the trip was my ego dying. I had experienced ego death without even realizing it. Hilarious. Now I was everything in the form of a nineteen year old girl and the next 7 hours would be me going from being everything back into human form. I realized that I had just experienced my birth which was also the birth of the universe and I think to myself “this was the greatest day of my life.” Extreme happiness right here and it stayed for the rest of the trip. I laughed about today being my birthday – my actual day of birth. It seemed much more appropriate to call today my birthday than call July 27th my birthday.\n\nI wanted so badly for others to experience what I had felt. This was, I feel, the ULTIMATE HUMAN EXPERIENCE. It was the greatest day of my life and the greatest thing I have ever done. I truly felt “at peace” with myself and everything. Unfortunately, I felt like there were few human beings healthy enough to handle these chemicals without going crazy because of our society. I remember thinking during the trip that there is a very thin line between tripping and crazy in our current society and that most human beings would not be able to handle what I had just gone through without freaking the fuck out. I wanted to convince my brother to try LSD, though, because he is the only person I know who would probably be able to handle the intensity level. At one point in my trip notes, I wrote:\n\n*TELL BROTHER TO EXPLORE LSD AND SHROOMS DEEPER TELL MY BROTHER THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THERE THAT I WANT HIM TO SEE*\n\nIt was the happiest day of my life, but the fact that most human beings would never experience what I had just experienced made me so sad. I figured if I called my brother right now, it might start a chain reaction that would lead up to him taking LSD and experiencing the greatest day of his life too. I was worried that when I sobered up I would never get the courage to start this chain reaction, so I decided to call him right now during my acid trip to leave a big impression. I wasn’t anxious about calling, but I wasn’t sure if I could make conversation, so I had to write what my message was on a piece of paper before I made the call. I wrote down “Have you ever considered doing lsd? I just had the greatest day of my life. I have never been happier! You need to try this! I am going to buy you lsd. You’re going to love it!” I figured this was enough conversation material to get the ball rolling and to get my point across. After this, it was up to him to start researching the effects of the drug in depth and start preparing his mind.\n\nThe next 7 hours were complete euphoria. I walked for eight hours straight stopping only for food, water, and weed to smoke to intensify the experience. Over the next seven hours, I walked down State Street, listened to Phish and the Flaming Lips, thought a lot, and learned what it was like to once again feel like a human being. This trip awakened the love of science in me."

        "description": " About an hour in, the nausea went away and I began to feel like I was tripping. At one point, I felt like I was having a bad trip or had stopped tripping completely. I felt like the 4-aco-dmt hadn’t worked after all. I was ready to go back to my computer or back to bed when I figured I’d try to go outside.\n\nWhen I got outside, my trip totally changed. I saw beautiful visuals. At one point, I saw Obama (United States president) visuals everywhere. I saw visuals of multiple presidents on the underpass near my apartment. I felt like I was taking ‘the walk to enlightenment’ or something. I started seeing pyramid eye visuals everywhere. I saw faces in the sky. There was a black baby looking down at me from the sky. The wind became a part of me. I became a part of everything. A sense of oneness overcame me. I was so excited I started laughing out loud because I had realized the answer to the universe. I couldn’t stop smiling and laughing. I felt amazing.\n\nI wrote down:\n\n*\"Wow. Never before have I realized the oneness of it all. We all are one. Even now, while tripping, I see eyes. A pyramid of an eye. I have seen the truth. Wow. I have figured out the universe. The oneness was a circle. The universe is a circle.\"*\n\nI was able to connect myself with all objects — rocks, the wind, other people. I thought it was beautiful how two people could find each other. How your consciousness can cling to a different shell of itself. Sex was beautiful for this reason. It allowed your consciousness to become one.\n\nEvery time I would go inside to go to the bathroom, I would start having a bad trip. To aid this, I started singing. I listened to Vanessa Carlton’s music while tripping and it was fucking amazing. Music has never sounded better. And the things she would sing would sometimes connect with my thought processes. I could find meaning in her lyrics, meanings that weren’t there before.\n\nI realized that for love to exist, hate must exist. For anger to exist, peace must exist. Yin and yang. Opposite forces need each other for each to exist. I wanted to become a shell of peace and compassion.\n\nAfter walking for a while, I decided to head back in. I knew that if i went inside now, I would not be able to trip further. But I decided to head inside to record my thoughts about the trip.\n\nUnfortunately, I wasn’t really able to get anything out in words. This is what I wrote on Microsoft Word:\n\n*\"wow. the wind*\n\n*wow*\n\n*wow*\n\n*wow*\n\n*i can’t even describe it*\n\n*WE ARE ALL ONE*\n\n*i don’t even know how to explain it.*\n\n*it*\n\n*is something you FEEL*\n\n*go back outside lol\"*\n\nBut it was cold and windy, so I decided to stay in. I was done with my trip for today. Hours later, I look on my phone and see that while outside I had written:\n\n\n*\"The oneness of it all is fucking Incredible fucking incredible. We sre all one. I am this rock. Circle. The oneness of it all. Remember it. You have been given a glimpse\"*"

    "introduction": "This is an account of how I achieved a level 3 state of unity and interconnectedness through meditation and without the use of hallucinogens.\n\nPrior to the experience I had been practising the meditation technique known as mantra chanting twice a day for 5 months. I did this every day for a total of 30 minutes in the morning at sunrise and 30 - 60 minutes after dinner, rarely if ever breaking this schedule.\n\nThe mantra itself was a traditional chant from the teachings of [Nichiren Daishonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichiren), a Buddhist monk who lived in japan and taught devotion to the [Lotus Sutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Sutra) (entitled Myōhō-Renge-Kyō in Japanese)— which contained Buddha's teachings towards the end of his life as the exclusive means to attain enlightenment. The chant itself is pronounced as \"[nam myoho renge kyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namu_My%C5%8Dh%C5%8D_Renge_Ky%C5%8D)\" and can be roughly translated as \"I devote myself to the mystic law of the lotus sutra\". This chant is traditionally repeated over and over again whilst staring at what is known as an enshrined [gohonzon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gohonzon). \n\nTowards the end of this 5 month period I achieved a state of unity at the end of an intense 2 week period of mantra mediation. I would partake in two hours of mediation or Daimoku, as it's called in the practice of Nichiren Buddhism, for one hour in the morning, as close to sunrise as possible, and a hour in the evening. I continued this routine for two and a half weeks without fail. At the end of the two and a half weeks, I started my mediation that evening as normal and about 40 minutes into the chanting I entered a trance-like state. This was how I described it at the time, but now through use of hallucinogens I can relate it closer to psychedelic ego death as I lost all sense of self and did not know who or what I even was.\n\nIn this state I was able to analyse the problems I was trying to help solve through mediation without any personal attachment or interference from the ego, to which I then felt oneness with the entirety of my environment. I began to feel that myself and everything around me were in perfect equilibrium, it reacted to me as I did to it in perfect harmony. This feeling only lasted minutes, which was probably due to my age, knowledge and life experiences as the sudden change in perspective shocked and scared me bringing me out of the feeling of oneness and back into my normal state of consciousness."

This ginger supplement significantly reduced nausea and prevented me from throwing up. I will be taking ginger capsules thirty minutes before all of my trips from now on.\n\nI am experienced with 4-aco-dmt/mushrooms, but because I had not tripped for over three months and have issues with general anxiety and social anxiety, I was very anxious about tripping again. I wanted a very therapeutic trip to ease me back into the psychedelic realm after a stressful couple of months. The purpose of this trip was for deep introspection and to reduce my anxiety levels. I had been avoiding my friends and acquaintances for months due to my social anxiety and I hoped that this trip would help me deal with my anxiety towards them. Before tripping, I asked the 4-aco-dmt if it would allow me to cry. I hadn’t cried in quite some time and I felt like I needed a release.",

I looked up and saw an angry god-like figure made of clouds glaring down at me. He looked like the typical Christian white-bearded god and had sharp, pointed ears to show that he was expressing anger. God’s arms were spread wide and around him, also made of clouds, were his angels.\n\nAs an agnostic who has little interest in Christianity, I usually do not expect Christian images to come up in my trips. However, throughout this entire trip, my thoughts often turned to Christianity. I was curious to know why the Christian god was glaring angrily down at me/humanity.\n\nA couple days after this trip, I Google imaged “angry god” and came upon Michelangelo’s painting The Creation of the Sun, Moon, and Plants located on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. This painting, located on the left side of the page, is similar to what I saw in the clouds, although it has its differences. Cloud-god was facing down towards me, he looked much angrier, there were no male cloud-angels, the female cloud-angels were spread out differently, and I could not see the facial expressions.\n\nSo here I am, walking down the street looking up at the Christian god glaring down at me. I think *“I don’t know what you’re trying to tell me, god. I’m not a believer.”* I wasn’t scared of the presence for some reason. During my walk, I felt oddly blessed by the wrathful Christian god and his angels. I had a delusion that god was literally watching me during this trip and teaching me things. I also confirmed that I was indeed god.\n\nAt around 4:00 PM I asked the figure in the clouds, *“Why so angry, god?”*\n\nAnd a voice replied back, *“Yeah, god, why so angry?”*\n\nI thought for a while and replied back *“I am angry because everything is not perfect. I am angry at myself and humanity for giving into evil…”*\n\nAfter this, I felt a lot better. Things were starting to get trippier and I noticed some little men working inside my brain. I could communicate with them and they would communicate back to me. I asked the little men inside my brain to change my vision to green just for fun. A few seconds later, the colors in my vision shifted to purple.\n\n*“Huh? What happened? I thought you were changing my visuals to green.”* I thought.\n\n*“Why not purple? Everything is already green outside!”* said one of the little men inside my brain.\n\nThis was true. I was walking down a very green garden-type area.\n\nFeeling anxiety again, I asked the little men inside my brain if I could stop fear with my mind and if they would help. They said sure and I mentally pictured myself cutting my fear with scissors. I started getting a weird body high after this and wondered if I had accidentally cut the wrong cord inside my body because I was still experiencing fear and my body started to feel weird.\n\nDuring one of my past trips on 4-aco-dmt, I saw a translucent rhino-dinosaur entity and crossed the street to avoid stepping inside of it. During my current trip, I saw the same entity but this time it leapt in front of me, surprising the shit out of me and causing me to accidentally step inside of it. While I was inside of the rhino-dinosaur entity, more translucent rhino-dinosaur entities appeared around me and I had strange thoughts concerning an Earth that is mind-controlled by invisible rhino-dinosaurs."

Things felt more and more epic as I got closer to home. I walked into my house and experienced a direct morphing effect. I walked up the stairs and noticed the hallway in front of my room seemed smaller/thinner than usual. I heard my neighbor shuffling around and his door was open. I wanted to quickly sneak into my room before he noticed me because of my social anxiety. The hallway was dark, but I saw that there was enough light to get my key in. When I moved closer to the door, however, the colors shifted and my vision suddenly got darker and I was unable to get my key into the lock. It felt like the shrooms were forcing me to socialize by shifting the colors around it making it impossible for me to open my door and hide.\n\nI walked to the other side of the hallway to the light switch, passed my neighbor (who I had never met before), and turned on the light switch. My neighbor came out of his room. He had his personal furniture and items all over the hallway, so I casually asked him if he was moving out. He replied *“Nope, just cleaning out my closet.”* *“Me too, dude, me too...”* He went back into his room. This is the first time that I have talked to him. Another housemate’s seven year old daughter came up to me in the hallway while I was opening my door and I asked if she would like to paint nails sometime. I agreed to paint nails in a couple days and then walked into my bedroom. I felt as if I had just faced my last demon – my anxiety surrounding my housemates.\n\nI sat on my bed and my focus shifted to deep introspection. I felt like crying but no tears were coming out. I realized that I was very dehydrated and got a glass of orange juice. As soon as I had a drink, the tears flowed out. My crying was quiet at first but then got louder and louder. I thought about everything bad that had happened to me and all of my faults. I cried because I wanted so badly to connect with someone but can’t. I often feel like I am missing a part of me. And that missing this part means that I will never be able to form a deep connection with anyone."

I was both crying and laughing at the same time and I felt so euphoric. It felt like an enormous weight had been lifted. When I looked at the clock, the time read 5:00 PM.\n\nI experienced feelings of unity and interconnectedness. I felt like I was god and all humans and animals and molecules. I stopped being afraid of death. It felt like my life was a big joke because I had created everything in this universe and I was still completely and utterly alone. I experienced visual patterns of the eye of providence on my wall. I looked in the mirror. In my face I saw the faces of all men and women on earth. I also felt like I could see and feel all of the muscles in my body. I was captivated by the sight of my body breathing. I could see my lungs pumping in and out with such beautiful detail and intensity. I saw tribal marks on my face and skin. Enhancement of pre-existing tactile sensations."

Instead, there was a grey fuzziness and nothing was distinct.\n\nI felt iron fingers all over my body, and when I closed my eyes and sat back the fingers gripped me and were dragging me in an arch out of this world and into the Other. I felt like I was moving backwards and sideways, with the final destination (back inside my body) in sight. This way, I could visualise how long the salvia was going to last. But I was also worried about going backwards too far, in case I didn’t come back...\n\nWhen I was in the Otherworld, I could see a witch and wizard (I smoked the salvia through a wizard-shaped bong), made out of the grey, fuzzy, non-descript visuals (think TV static). There could have been more of them but I can’t be sure.\n\nThey were telling me, in sinister voices, “You will die. You will ruin everything and take your friends with you.” I was frightened, and could imagine the police coming and arresting us all, and it all being my fault (though I knew that salvia is legal in the UK). I prematurely ended the trip by opening my eyes, standing up, and walking away from the bong. That was it, nothing more, though it did set The Fear in me which stayed for the beginning of my ayahuasca trip later that day."

I remember flashes of feeling pursuit from an entity through these void structures. \n\nThis started manifesting as recursion, I would snap back to the start of the scenario where I realize I’m on Oppa and that I was being chased. However this also occurred with a completely different setting and “entities” with only the theme being the recursive element. Each scenario’s structure was fundamentally different, at one point I was descending into what felt to be a forest fragmented across the void of indescribable proportions and complexity, the further I descended into the forest structure the darker and more ominous it became with the feels of pursuit becoming inescapable. As the feeling of being chased grew in strength so did the bizarre forest it had reached a point where the forest had closed in on me and oppa leaving nowhere to go, then the recursion happened again and I entered a new void structure of arched hallways and large rooms with infinitely high ceilings. Near the end of the infusion after multiple recursions of setting with the same consistent theme of pursuit and evasion the entity had eventually caught up with me and sat alongside me occupying the periphery of my vision as a semi-human figure. I tried looking at the figure multiple times but could never have it centered in my vision, each time I tried I would start drifting away again on top of Oppa. \n\nAt this point the Dr returned to the room to see how much was left in the IV, he said that there was a little left and injected the remainder of the IV all at once before removing the IV which was an absolute rush as my vision disconnected again and I was right back to Oppa with the entity finally in the center of my vision. It was an amorphous creature that looked vaguely human but was constantly shifting in color/shape and almost dissolving into nothing all at the same time. The moment I laid my eyes on the entity I started feeling some extreme uncertainty over my existence, whether my girlfriend was in the room or if she was also a hallucination, and if I was ever going to return to the world.\n\nI started dissolving away along with the entity with my vision gradually compressing information down into a single point with a torrent of emotions about a job I had recently lost, these emotions also started dissolving as I became more and more disconnected from myself and my mind, I started feeling a great sense of peace and unity at this point with my vision having become a black/red tunnel ringed with twisted fractals that spread out to the edges of my vision.

In that time, the water had become a murky greenish color, with bits of …stuff… floating in it. It had become pretty nasty but I wasn’t going to give up what amounted to maybe 5 or 6 more doses that I had paid for, having only gotten 2 experiences so far. So I emptied the bottle (there were small black flecks attached to the bottle all over the inside) and boiled the water. I then filtered the water to get the solid pieces out. It was still a murky greenish color (though it had gotten a black tint to it now). The water smelled like mildew and tasted metallic. Well fuck. I decided to put it aside in my fridge until I got the chance to test it. That chance came about a week later. I obviously hadn’t killed what dwelt in my water, as the water was now a very murky almost opaque greenish black. Wow. I decided I would test to see if anything psychedelic or redeemable still existed in there and measured out 100 mL. I measured the 4-AcO-DMT so there would be 1 mg per 2 mL. If whatever in this water was still 4-AcO-DMT (also the concentration probably got messed up through boiling it), it would’ve been a roughly 50 mg dose. Oops, very reckless.

        "description": "We are walking the first two dogs now, one is a big hyperactive puppy, the other is an old melty dog who seems to want nothing more than to exist peaceably. The puppy dances around me and jumps onto my leg as the sunlight catches his fur and butters him with radiant warmth. His compatriot trudges onwards, eyes on the prize. The sun, the glorious sun, it beams down on us as we walk, tickling away the vestiges of the previous day’s rain, glinting on what water has not yet retreated to the atmosphere. We walk along the wet street under the morning sky, chatting and joking, I look like a grimy degenerate, he looks like a very nice boy, but everyone looks nice in full morning sun. Everything is getting warmer, my body, the air around me, it's all heating up, it's all cooking. I pry my eyes into the sky and into the road and bushes to see if I can tease out visuals but they refuse to make themselves known, it’s still the sense of heat waves passing over my brain and sweeps of electric pulses down my muscles and a stirring in my gut that lets me know I am on the comeup. Every color looks brighter. Every light looks washed out. The sounds of children playing at recess at a nearby school flit through the air like javelins. We reach the end of the walk and make our way back. The sky sighs and surrenders itself to the visuals I had been longing for. Deep breaths, each exhale glowing like bellows breathing into embers, light teal and pink glow and sizzle at the edges of vast sweeping and swirling blocks and patterns in the cloudless blue above. But it is still glassy, gentle, and unintrusive. The vast pillar of the visible light spectrum hammers the earth and my prismatic eyes begin to pick it apart into its color spectrum- my skin flashing purple here, the bushes taking on a blue hue over there. Bright red and orange crack the sky like lightning, on this quiet cloudless day pockmarked by birdsongs. All around me colors are shuffling, morphing and fusing into their neighbors on the spectrum. The nausea starts to set into my stomach and I am glad to return to the car where I can sit down and curl up. The puppy is still full of vigor and the old dog is still full of wanting to go home, they regard me as a passing curiosity before continuing on with their busy fruitful lives in the sun."

        "description": "We drive to the second house- perched at the top of a valley with steep wooded sides that filter the golden sunlight into an iridescent bronze that settles in its creeks and crevasses. He ascends a steep driveway to retrieve the dog (I am of course, not permitted to go in or near the houses of his clients), an excitable set of jaws with a furry body attached. This dog loves to look to us for approval before demonstrating his mighty mighty teeth. The sun reflecting off the wet asphalt is blinding and the corners of my vision are beginning to stir and blur together into a dense root-tangle of patterns drawn from my surroundings. Cool colors dominate this trip, with patches of my visual field being overtaken by shifting fields and blocks of deep blues and vibrant teals and magentas and violets and creamy greens. The visuals are still not distinct or intrusive, but are an adornment of the beautiful forested valley around me, like extra flowers blossoming prematurely on this unseasonably warm winter day. The wind rustles through their bare branches and pulls swatches of colors with it like spilling a glass of water onto a watercolor painting. I return to my friend’s car and kick back and take stock of what I’m feeling- my brain is warm, stimulated, it feels like its frying and sizzling in the sun as it climbs towards its midday apex. I am viewing the world through spangled rippled glass, each distortion catching the ambient light at different angles, embedding this world in a vast tangle of air-clear pleochroic crystals that pass gently around me as we drive. I see swirling violet patterns on my skin, very little of the familiar fractals and geometry other psychedelics might imbue, but rather it seems that this one flushes the world with vibrant color and lets their streams knit together and coalesce into a grand breathing shifted polychrome extravaganza. It’s such a beautiful sunny day."

I feel the full force of a trillion photons streaming into my face, of my nerves sensing the light, the warmth that they impart, and passing that message through the rest of my body. I am a great glowing colossus of flesh with constant internal motion, highways and subways and hyperspeed rails tracing efficient paths through me to ensure function, all glowing, all sizzling with energy. I feel like my organ systems have been separated into discrete sensations and I am loving every second of it. The sunlight splatters on the windshield and diffracts into a spectrum of brilliant colors that splash and splinter onto everything around me before slinking away into whatever shadows they can find. I am under a stained glass cascade that dyes the world around me into something more vibrant and beautiful than I could ever imagine. The trees are a lovely magenta hue, the crevasses of their bark guarded by bulwarks of brusque deep turquoise. Aside from all the color shifts the visuals are still fairly subdued, not much geometry to speak of just vibrant color shifts.My friend comes to retrieve me. This dog is like a loaf of bread, she is very polite and I get a sense that this walk is her giving me a tour of her route. I am grateful for her guidance. The trees shift and swirl around me, with the same subtlety one would observe a line of ants traversing their surface. Every passerby is alien, vaguely threatening but not worth my anxiety."

We drive around for a bit before arriving at a dam on the river, an overgrown concrete monolith that languishes in the sun and the trash in the water that gushes through it. Being the passenger in a vehicle is exhilarating, I myself feel like a dog, wanting to take in every sight and sense and sound that pass us by. I want to stick my head out the window and take in all of this information that is passing me by so quickly- I don’t fret at not being able to take it all in though, I just revel the power of this furious high speed cascade of sensory information. I find solace in thinking about how much of this world there was, so many little details and cracks and crevasses, plants growing on sidewalks and paint splatters and stains on buildings and leaves on trees and all the little things in the windows of people’s houses, and how it’s okay that I don’t know about them right now, they would always be there for me to explore.\n\nThe world streams around me gently as we disembark from the car and make our way down to the dam. Conversation flows and chatter bounces around like little birds. Visuals are subdued and mostly come in as color shifts and barely discernible drifts in texture. The power of the sun stains the sky with a geodesic stratosphere. I am cooking in the vibrating, bubbling tension of the world. We trudge through mud and clamber around collapsing structures encrusted with a dense ecosystem of graffiti, pulsing vibrant epiphytes on the crumbling stone"

The light is so bright and intense that I feel like I should be able to hear it, the sound of vibrating glass lasers through the sky. We engage with our environment physically (of note- my friend has been sober this entire time), skipping stones, throwing rocks into the water, swinging sticks around. We smash things and break things and collide things with one another. Its visceral and juvenile and feels so good to exert myself with no purpose. Nothing is a waste so long as my body is in motion. I smoke some cannabis from my one hitter as I romp around, laughing and joking with my dear friend. The visuals have settled into the background as a subtle bas-relief, manifesting as iridescent sheens and flashes on all the dazzling plays of light around me. Everything looks stark, monolithic aesthetic contrast, the sharp blasted gray of the dam plastered onto the dense azure jelly of the sky, with quivering bubbling breathing writhing tree branches cooking their way into its margins, the color of acorns and cold chocolate. Every element of the visual field just wants to strut and yell."

I wasn’t planning on it but I do pride myself on my ability to make and tend to a fire. I am so hyped up now, I have a mission, I quickly and manically hew out a pit for a fire, gather tinder, kindling, and wood, and get a nice campfire going in a few minutes (even though it wasn’t even cold outside). I make a fan from a plastic bag stretched across a Y-shaped branch that lets me fan the flames to build them nice and hot. It feels nice to do something with competence, it feels so nice to accomplish a goal. I fee like I am baking in my sense of accomplishment, along with baking in the fire and sun. I feel good about myself, I feel good about being a being running around in the sun right now making the most of a beautiful day. Like the luckiest critter on earth, like a bear in a lake of honey. My friend offers me his cannabis oil vaporizer which I repeatedly hit. Each hit feels like blowing onto a fire, the visuals flare for a bit and gently trace their way out of my vision. The smoke from the fire is noticeably iridescent, an aethereal fairy mist over the trash and rubble strewn around the bank.\n\nWe decide to head back home to meet with another good friend. I wrestle with my first friend, it was extremely fun to physically exert myself on a warm day. It felt like being a teenager and skipping school, nostalgic euphoria washed over me.\n\nWe drive back through an extremely tight and hilly and fast part of the city, it is an intense experience (especially because I had gotten in a car accident myself a few days before), rife with visible tension between the forces at work. Everything zips by as the sun crawls lower into the sky. I get a call from a mental health treatment program asking if I would like to participate in a study. I am able to hold a coherent and effective and articulate conversation with a complete stranger through a phone. In general I have felt very lucid throughout this entire experience."

Interacting with dear pets while tripping is a lovely experience, and it feels like they are even more affectionate. Time passes, there are four of us now, some of my oldest and closest friends, we are playing videogames and hanging out smoking a lot of weed. I am certainly coming down, the visuals are all but a memory at this point. Upon smoking copious weed however, the trip climbs back out of its hole. Odd physical dissociative sensations give a warm solidity to my skull and scramble some proprioception. Visuals timidly flash as a newfound glittering energy rises through me. This wears off after about an hour. Sometimes with psychedelics, the comedown has me feeling more articulate and capable and confident than I am when sober. Other times (perhaps with excess cannabis consumption), I feel blank, dumb, locked into whatever sensory blips I can still discern. I definitely feel this way now, mostly at a loss for words, only able to focus on the very neutral feeling of something baking in my skull, radiating gentle fading colors. Time passes into stoniness."

    "conclusion": "This is another one theorized to be a prodrug to LSD, as are most lysergamides it seems. Yet this one seems to have stood out in several ways- Firstly, the visuals- most lysergamides carry a distinct class of visual for me, reminiscent of art produced by indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest and Mesoamerica. This is typically replete with glyphs, animal figures, pareidolia, and stark well-defined patterns. These sorts of visuals were entirely absent for this trip, with the visual aspect mostly manifesting as alterations- shifts in colors and textures and the general aesthetic composition and contrast of my visual field. It altered my input rather than producing new images. It was also remarkably lucid, I found myself for the most part functional and discrete. Yet I wouldn’t attribute the light visuals and lucidity to a low dose- cognitively this substance dogged me with energy and light, it was thoroughly engaging and introspective, articulate and holistic, often in a way that is typically accompanied with stronger sensory effects. In similarities to other lysergamides, it had fairly standard duration, potency, bodyload, and stimulation. Definitely had distinct lysergamide qualities in the psychosomatic feel of it. The overall attributes of the trip I would describe as lucidity, with light overall visuals mostly built of alterations, but with an underlying cognitive intensity and depth that makes for a truly profound, though not necessarily intense, experience.",

I can get up and walk around and do things and it feels as though the experience has taken a back seat while I do. Nevertheless, if I sit still and focus, it returns in full force. There is still a sense of pressure, like the energy of the drug is literally clutching my brain, though it seems as though I can loosen its grip through sheer willpower. In the white spaces on my computer screen a flashing iridescent honeycomb pattern begins to weave its way inwards. I sink into my bed as a pattern of concentric levels of dissociative pressure stratify discretely outwards from my brain."

I turn my lights off and the darkness becomes dominated by shooting red and blue beams of light, collapsing into static stippling patterns. I feel so energetic and manic, not the sort of “do what you want without consequences” mania that drugs like PCP can impart, but a kind of “You can do so much in so little time” type of mania. Though I don’t particularly want to do anything other than droop and melt and sag and enjoy the flashy visuals and the neon green auras around everything. The experience seems to sit in the background, participating in warping my perceptions when I give it the opportunity to volunteer. It is by no means forceful or uncontrollable, there is no rush or intensity to it. My mental ability also feels dulled and suppressed, I mostly just feel like I am lying here with a blank and empty mind. "

Everything I see with my open eyes is tinted a glowing green now, and my head is rising like an inflating helium balloon. On the smooth and mottled surfaces in my vision is an endless field of textures resembling cells, perfectly interlocked. The extremities and apices of my body glow like St. Elmos fire, casting a ghostly light into the night. The night is a monolithic wriggling and writhing darkness that closes in on me, an unctuous medium that threatens to envelop me in the chaos it contains in cryptic infinitum. Blocks and dark shapes lurk ambiguously at the tingling corners of my vision, moving freely in the nearly-indiscernible static that encroaches inwards on my field of view. My feet feel like yarn, I do not know if I could easily stand up anymore. I can still pull myself out of the experience at will though, at least mentally, which seems to also dampen the sensory effects. But I’m enjoying myself and feel no need to do this. Concentric ripples begin to spread and collide and interfere with one another, filling my vision with their gentle distortion. My notes have become noticeably incoherent and typo-ridden at this point, suggesting an increasing mental and physical impairment."

I underestimated this compound, it has metamorphosed from a gentle fleeting sort of experience into a more comprehensive hallucinatory dissociative trip. It feels like a brush that has swept my entire existence across the floor in one big smear. It is cold, it is massive yet rises and floats with an incredible evacuative energy like an explosion of helium. There is such an immense pressure enveloping me, my head feels like it’s shaped like a cylinder, and the prevailing sense of the experience becomes one of hollowness, of a great cold void inside of all things, vacuous and breezy like a gaping icy maw in the endless darkness of space. It is a trip that is dense and massive in its emptiness, like a puddle of tar engulfing me in zero gravity.\n\nThe closed eye visuals present like great tendrils swirling in a spiral around me. They vibrate across my body, they carry it through time. I feel like I am a brick arch spanning a river.  I feel like I am floating on a boat on a very still pond at night, illuminated by the silvery moon, with a distinct chill in the air. The waves of numbness tingle across my body rhythmically as a dense mental dissociation wraps me in its umbral legs like a great spider, my entire sense of self melting and drooping at every point of contact with its slick chitin. It wraps me up and draws me into the abyssal cavern of the empty sky, illuminated by flashes of fiery crackling green. I am still cold and shivering. All of my cells become alight with freezing green fire, casting my form into the void in an atomized jet. The particles rise ever upwards, coalescing into interlocking triangles, amidst a backdrop of collages pulled from my recent memory, sights I saw in my waking day as I walked around the city, interspersed with imaginary landscapes of pinnacles of twisted black rock against a violet night sky. The images collapse into a dense collection of branching fronds that withdraw and recede into the hollow darkness. I am nothing again before the darkness itself collapses back into explosive and frenetic color and energy."

The entire experience feels so clean and clear and cogent, despite my heavily dulled mind. I am being tossed about by waves over an immense ocean with my head above water the entire time. It is deep and dark and so comprehensive in its power.\n\nIt doesn’t carry the crushing force or the sheer momentum and magnitude that other dissociatives can carry, in my ability the willfully pull myself from the experience , it feels neutered on more derived and fundamental levels and it feels almost virtual. It is a dissociative shell around a great emptiness, it is being weightless in the void as you ripple through its boundaries. I can still get up and walk if I want to it turns out. I venture out into the dark hallway outside of my room and the walls are covered in images in blue relief. They appear as great human faces, though totally alien and soulless like statues.

    "conclusion": "Short sweet and intense yet hollow. With any new dissociative that appears on the market, there is a temptation to draw comparisons to the dodo bird of dissociatives, the elusive and much revered MXE. I will say they are hardly comparable. MXPr lacks the weight and force of other arylcyclohexylamines, there seems to be no \"core\" to it. It feels like a dissociative shell over a great hollow nothingness. It is surprisingly lucid despite its intensity at points, and I found myself able to pull myself in and out of the experience at will. It lacks the euphoric rush of other dissociatives, and while manic at times, it is not the fiery mentally stimulating mania that can be found with the others, it's a light and floaty sort of mania.\n\nThere isn't as much mental acuity or enhancement or introspection, but rather in line with that hollow feeling, it feels like it instills a sort of dullness and mental impairment, like my brain has become empty too. The physical effects are strong, with noticeably acute anesthesia and loss of balance, though even these can be suppressed with enough focus. It's hard to say if I was in a hole state or not due to the degree of control I maintained for the entire experience. Later tests with higher doses (up to 100 mg intranasal) proved more difficult to control but it was still possible. Also of note is that it induced nausea to a degree not usually felt with dissociatives. It is also remarkably pretty and visual compared to other dissociatives, with lots of of vibrant colors adorning everything in my open eyed field of vision. It seems to instill a sort of hallucinatory light, with bright colorful glows and auras around everything. The visuals are fairly detailed and the imagery forms as tendrils and patterns and pareidolia, reminiscent of psychedelics. It has a sort of 'cyberpunk' character and it would be a fun drug  character to take at a dark club or festival or show, and it would be super interesting to see how it does in combination with other drugs. Overall, it is a short and at times fairly lucid and clean experience lacking in stimulation or euphoria or weight, but with a good degree of physical dissociation and vibrant and intense colorful, flashy visuals.",

Anyways, aside from this, it was an interesting psychedelic, it had a nature of being very taut, springy, and vibrate-y. It was thin and high pitched but harmonious. I want to try it again, to see if the nausea really was from the drug or was some other factor. There really is only one way to confirm that :P",

Almost instantly it feels like the world has shifted and I have entered back into another realm. This is good, I like where this is going. K feels so cold. I feel like I’ve snorted ice, that this icy numbness is radiating from my sinuses outwards. This is by no means uncomfortable or unpleasant, it just is. It is extremely and fundamentally neutral.

I don’t know if what I am anticipating is some perceived leveled off peak or perhaps something deeper and more powerful. For now it simply evades my grasp. Visuals have begun to manifest, though they are slight and escape notice unless specifically focused on- concentric auras around everything, particularly in areas of high contrast, they are radiant and ever so slightly iridescent but they tend to fade into the mess of things. With my eyes closed, I don’t ‘see’ visuals but I can perceive the motion and energy of great, all encompassing images around me. It’s like the drug is challenging me to understand and utilize my senses in creative synesthetic ways. The world is doused in ripples and barely conceivable shifts in perception that I must explore and discover through comparative rigor.

The summer air that settled like a blanket over the little pond has been stirred into tender swirls and currents that enshrine my limbs and hold me aloft. I float along hazily and ascend a tree limb that reaches out over the water bathed in the emerald green light reflecting off the abundant duckweed below. Lying on this limb, I am enveloped in the most immaculate comfort, as if this tree was made to perfectly fit the contours of my body, or vice versa.\n\nMy existence is adorned by the golden sunlight rocketing down from the glorious sky, imparting the eggshell clouds with a painterly quality. The fluttering and harmonious songs of birds dance between the blossoming and breathing trees and swathes of insects dance on the surface of the water, catching the rays of the sun and glowing like strings of Christmas lights. I close my eyes and sink into the world breathing and living around me, I become enveloped in its vitality and the respiration of every life form around me.\n\nRadiating patterns swirl from the center of my vision, composed of triangles and glowing, pulsing lanes between them. These patterns are not particularly colorful or vibrant, rather they are neutral and earthy, a reflection of the deep earthiness I feel crawling up the tree branch like ivy and creeping into my core. Nature truly is not blissful or harmonious in any human sense- it is a cacophony of species destroying one another to survive, it is efficiency and brutality and perpetual fear for one’s own life. But there is beauty in that- beauty in how well adapted each organism is for its specific mode of survival, beauty in the way that some species depend on overcoming that, tranquility in knowing that every species is doing exactly as it is supposed to. It’s a feeling of acceptance that cannot be overcome, it’s the stoic and unrelenting harmony of nature. I feel grateful to be able to sink into it, to know how much life comes from so much suffering. The warmth of the sun, the fuel of this great chaotic and concordant engine, tickles my skin, lends its energy to my cells. I can only breathe in and out deeply, despite the earlier speediness I am entirely still, I sigh as a great warm smile stretches across my face- there is no place I would rather be than right here, right now."

The others with me seem to be enjoying their experiences but they too have grown weary. One of them has become quite pale. We begin the trudge back to familiar territory. The entirety of the experience thus far has been very outrospective, I am not considering myself much, I am not anchored in my own thoughts and emotions.

I do not feel uncomfortable around them in the least, even volunteering to take a picture of a family that was struggling to attempt a selfie. We pause next to the river and gaze out over the rippling surface of the water for some time. We are all so peaceful in this moment, subject to the beauty of the sun and the sky and the water, the beauty of so many people out enjoying themselves on such a glorious day, the beauty of the trees in full bloom and the clouds drifting lazily above and the city catching the sun’s light just down the trail. It’s such a wondrous moment and I am grateful that I got to be there with these people who I loved so much. We eventually continue walking, joking and laughing and talking the whole way, people watching and in general just taking in the sights and sounds around us.

My friends go out to get food, leaving me alone to take in the renewed experience. I stare at the ceiling and am greeted by a great, pointy, radiating floral pattern, adorned by overlapping scales at its outer edges, the entire array of forms pulsing with pastel colors.\n\nThe entire room appears hazy as these patterns dance and swirl above me, a lazy geometric ballet above my head, swimming in the summer heat. The hot breath of the mysterious forms cascades onto me like a warm rain, or the drool of some esoteric being. I am encapsulated by bliss, I sigh as even the shaking in my limbs feels calm and harmonious. I feel faint and foggy and it’s just fantastic.

    "conclusion": "Serenity, Tranquility, Peace, is certainly a fitting nickname for this substance. This is absolutely one of the most gentle psychedelics I have tasted, save for some bumpiness on the come up. It’s a calm, peaceful, and harmonious experience that made me feel jubilant to just exist in the world. I didn’t find it particularly introspective, rather it made me ruminate blissfully on my surroundings throughout. The physical feelings of comfort were unmatched by anything else. It was quite euphoric and lacked the nervous stimulation of other phenethylamines- particularly odd for being a substituted amphetamine. The only intense aspect of it was the intensity of the serene bliss it induced, and the long sputtering duration. I’m curious as to how this pushed so many hippies into freaking out way back when, aside from the length. I would certainly be interested in pushing it at higher doses to see just what the boundaries of this tranquility are- to see if the energy changes way beyond the borders of what I experienced. If only it was easier to acquire….",

I practice my spatial awareness by mapping the tangled network of trails through the forest in my mind, running through them and retracing them to create a detailed map in my head. There is a large Memorial Day BBQ in the park nearby and the heavy bass of the live DJ resonates constantly through the grey air. The leaves and trees and dirt around me are all moving in a way that makes it appear as they are composed of thousands of little crawling creatures. The restless feeling in my body has given way to a pleasurable dry burn, it’s a warm comfort pressing on me from all sides. I feel absolutely great.\n\nRunning around in the woods, I am stricken by an almost tear-jerking sense of nostalgia and longing. It reminds me of my days as a teenager romping around in the woods with my friends, looking for snakes and making campfires. It must be the smell of the Japanese Knotweed and the mud around me and the towering maple trees above and the dappled sunlight as it filters through the leaves and clouds. I am blissful here and the shifting light locks its fingers around the visuals, creating a most harmonious interplay."

Every moment and every thought feels so profound and worthy of consideration, I feel both irradiated and radiant.\n\nThe visuals are still somewhat faint, they pulse and ripple and are quite flashy. It’s as if the entire world is composed of a gently strobing light. They are not particularly prominent or in my face, they are simply decoration on what so far feels like a very cognitive trip.

I feel spacy and cautious- as I wander further and further from people and civilization I begin to realize that anything could be lurking out here, there are not witnesses or anything.  Anyone could do anything to me. I am very on edge. I find a nice rock overlooking the tracks and take a break to perch up there. Anyone could sneak up from behind me and crack my skull or slit my throat and I would be out before I even noticed. One could say that I was being a bit paranoid. I pick up a railroad spike for protection.\n\nThe visuals have become much more apparent now. They are foliate patterns, radiating fronds flashing in green and deep violet. They unfurl and join together to form soft reliefs on every surface, carefully sculpted friezes that adorn the earth and sky. They are striped with light and dark gaussian bands that swing rhythmically through their forms, splashing their contours with color. The bricks and rocks making up the railroad bridges and tunnels and walls around me appear to be sculpted and carved with patterns reminiscent of Mesoamerican structures. It is as though I am amidst ancient ruins, long ago conquered by moss and vines, their brilliant visages timidly peek out."

I am tripping pretty hard now, with the trees surrounding the train tracks forming a pulsing, telescoping tunnel that flashes with alternating peristaltic oscillations of light and dark. The trees come off as sentient in this moment, as if they are watching over me, thinking about me, reacting to me. This idea does not seem too far-fetched when they are mirroring one another and rhythmically pulsing like jellyfish. The whole world is repeating itself around me and all I can think about is how completely wiped out I feel in the midst of this. Everything appears faded and foggy.\n\nThe visuals are still not very colorful, rather they are profound alterations of the world around me that seem to follow some esoteric biological guidelines that dictate the nature of their forms. My thoughts begin racing to accommodate this new paradigm and imagine the possibilities contained within a world where everything follows the self-replicating and self-preserving fundamentals of biology. The sense of the world buzzing with such vitality exudes warmth all around me.\n\nI feel manic and motivated to explore, it’s this desire to plunge in the unknown, peppered with an anxiety for what I may come upon in doing so. I find a cool swamp in the woods but panic and retreat when I hear footsteps in the distance- who may be all the way out here? I venture further down the tracks, coming upon a big rusty overgrown signaling structure spanning the tracks. I climb up upon it. This is extremely nerve-wracking- I am quite afraid of heights and the wet rickety and rusted ladder covered in vines does not come off as safe. I almost make it to the top before I realize that the catwalk is constructed from rotting wood that would surely not support me, dropping me 30 feet to the train tracks and railroad ballast below. Despite the overall warm numbness in my body and the dizzying sense of vitality, I still manage enough coordination to make it up and down the ladder safely.

I meet my friend and I am eager to explore this realm with him, showing him around like a tour guide.  I am flushed with a sense of competence and pride, a rare confidence that is typically elusive in my life. Socializing feels awkward on my part however- I find myself stumbling over my words and forgetting them mid-sentence. It’s as though the part of my brain responsible for word recall and articulation has become fried and scrambled. I don’t really mind though. I’ve been collecting railroad spikes just for the hell of it and at this point my backpack is weighed down by about 40 pounds of rusted iron. Each step I take is labored. I take him out to the swamp and we hang out there and smoke more cannabis. We make conversation, each word presenting as earnest and intimate and deeply significant, though it really was just normal conversation. Smoking more makes the visuals more apparent- There are evident and bold patterns now, geometric designs interspersed with blocky human faces. They are still not very colorful. My mind is racing less now, it mostly feels worn and burnt out. I feel somewhat slower and I am still struggling with words. We eventually leave, and walking back we encounter that same mysterious man wandering aimlessly around the tracks. He disappears into the woods and I find myself muffled and muzzled by a nervous tension. Nothing comes of it though. We have to navigate down a steep rock face to re-enter civilization. I find myself coordinated and capable of descending it with ease, despite the great burden on my back.\n"

We tried to play a badly glitching copy of Mario Party 4 on an old console with a very new TV. Something along the chain didn’t cooperate, the game was in black and white and would lag and freeze a lot, the music occasionally distorting. The entire experience was colored and overshadowed by an eerie discomfort. For a while the menu music continued against a frozen screen, it seemed to carry its own creepy sentience, a ghost mocking us from the digital realm. We eventually gave up."

They are timid and seem unsure of whether or not they themselves should be here. With my eyes closed there is not much to note either, just waves and pulses in dull colors.\n\nThe chills have faded to a grand rising rippling heat, it feels the way a boiling hot radiator feels on a snowy day, incredibly radiant, wet (I’m mildly sweaty), but not necessarily luminous or fiery. It’s like my body is a great big furnace. The heat energizes me, I feel so restless and I want to get up and do things and move around. Despite this visceral urge, I cannot come up with any particular reason to get up and do things, and all I could do really is pace around the house, so I just sit still and fidget. It feels spacy, not like I am spaced out, but like there is a huge empty volume to this trip. I feel like my mind is a child running around in a big empty room- a lot of energy to let out and nowhere for it to go, or no way for it to really affect the space around it. My thoughts are articulate and succinct, when I talk I feel like I am direct and to the point and earnest. It is pleasant to feel this way.\n\nThe bodyload continues, the same tension, restlessness, and nausea. Now an irritating urinary retention has set in too, a recurring side effect from phenethylamines. I constantly feel like I have to go but I can’t, and flushing myself with water doesn’t seem to do much. I am continuously hitting my Cannabis one hitter in hopes of abating some of these discomforts. Each hit feels like blowing on hot coals, they make the trip breathe and glow and emit more heat, it makes the visuals shine for a bit before they fade into the background again."

My one friend who loves comic books shows me some of the ones he brought and explains to me what he likes about them. It’s so fun to listen to him talk about something that he loves and it was really cool to engage in this media with him as a sort of guide, it fostered a newfound appreciation, particularly as I don’t read western comics much. The pages were not adorned with distinct visuals but it seemed as if the craftsmanship and composition behind the art particularly stood out. This feels like a psychedelic stimulant, not necessarily a “roll” though, with no empathogenic effects to note. Rather, it seems to shine most in the range of its cognitive effects, it feels as if the things I am engaging with are imprinting deeply on my memory like a brand. I send out long overdue correspondences with people online and read through forum posts about research chemicals. The things I type out feel articulate and salient, and it feels exciting to engage with people so far away.\n\nI spend a lot of time just sitting there petting my friend’s dog. It’s so nice to interact with this big mammal and have an animal respond positively to my presence. I find myself pondering how pleasant so many little things I take for granted are.\n\nThe urinary retention has become particularly marked as the other sides of the bodyload have receded. I find myself frequently having to get up and go and there is a persistent ache and itching tension in my lower abdomen, it is fairly unpleasant. My bladder feels like a weight that the rest of my body strains to hold in place."

This is grueling but also enjoyable, it fuels me with euphoria like a fresh rocket booster. Visuals have mostly died out by this point, just faint play and bright colors on the walls. The overall sense of internal dynamism and heat also plays on into the cold winter night."

    "conclusion": "This is an excellent psychedelic for socializing in any setting, it would be a lovely party drug but was also excellent for just lounging around with some very close friends. It would probably be very boring to take by myself. It is very hot and filled with energy, it’s a big furnace inside my body with infinite space for the heat to dissipate, it’s intrinsic energy bolting in every direction just for the sheer joy of it. It lends itself to articulate conversation and thought, not particularly introspective but rather it allows for a similar degree of careful analysis of the external experience. The comedown is a long, drawn out and stimulating psychedelic afterglow on the tails of a relatively short and manageable peak. The cognitive effects were strong, while most sensory effects were nondescript or hardly noticeable. Very unremarkable open eyed or closed eyed visuals, though they were definitely there they were subtle and escaped attention. The major drawback was the intensely uncomfortable urinary retention that persisted well after most other effects had subsided, even into the next day. Urinary retention is a fairly standard side effect of psychedelic phenethylamines for me, but this time was remarkably more uncomfortable than others (though not nearly as bad as 2C-iP was).",

Regardless though, the categories it fit into are: \n\nIntricate in complexity, abstract in style, synthetic in theme, unstructured in form, brightly lit in lighting, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, equally soft and sharp in its edges, small in size, fast in motion, jittery in framerate, non immersive, and consistent in intensity. \n\nWhen we compare notes afterwards the only difference was that she categorised her's as slow in motion, and I categorised mine as fast.

        "description": "After around 20 minutes of consuming the pills, I started to see mild distortions and audial hallucinations, mostly ticking and scratching, which seemed distant. I was inside the car which was going to the house I was supposed to spend my trip at, and I kept telling Martin [my friend] not to interfere with the trip in any way, unless it was obvious I'm in lethal danger. I noticed my memory span was becoming short, and the ticking and scratching was getting louder, along with a mild headrush-like high-pitched sound. Right before we reached his place, I realized I couldn't move and my vision started glitching up. It kept flashing and freezing, and sometimes I wouldn't see anything at all for a split second. I told this to Martin, and he convinced me I could walk, just had to do it carefully, so I followed him to the house. I was very, very heavy, and every time I looked at the floor, it seemed like my feet were sinking into it. I was left alone in the room, which was slowly melting, and most of the furniture had bright, unusual outlines. At this point, I felt crawling all over me. Vision flashed again, and I found myself completely covered in spider webs. Moving my hands trough them helped for a little while [hands would go trough them and they\\d fade] but the webs came back almost immediately. I could feel the sticky sensation on my skin, which made them seem just as real as I was.\n\nThen, there was a loud knock at the window. I turned around to see someone standing behind it, so i opened it. I heard music coming from outside. It was different from what I heard during my last trip - but strangely familiar and similar to it. \"let's go, Sedric.\" said the creature, and I climbed out the window without much consideration. It was extremely hard to walk. The grass and the trees seemed grainy and it looked like they were moving, crawling, breathing and living. My sense of time was severely distorted - few steps would feel like an eternity, or I would black out and confuse fairly long periods of time for a second. We were going towards the music, the creature walking few steps ahead of me. After a while, I started noticing lights [probably torches?] among trees, and hundreds of moths around them. The air was full of moths, and they would land on me and fly around. I tried my best to keep them out of my face, failing miserably.\n\nFinally, we reached a clearing. There were many people there. At the front, very still, stood my relatives, all dressed in black surrounded by shadows and people I don't know. They all seemed frozen and had the same blank expresion on their faces, eyes fixed on me. I tried to talk, but my voice got stuck in my throat. [It was extremely sore and dry.] I started feeling a mixture of guilt and fear, because I could tell they all knew the creature took me here because of DPH, and considering most of them were dead, I wasn't sure if I was still alive. Suddenly, there was a very unpleasant crackling sound and a white flash. The creature who took me here was gone now, and everyone was just walking around and talking, completely ignoring me. I decided to sit because of the heavyness.\n\nAfter a while, i noticed a black dot moving trough the grass towards me very quickly within the corner of my eye. Then, I would feel a bludge moving under my shirt at the right shoulder. I freaked out and smacked it, and a black rat fell out my sleeve. It looked dead, but every time I took my attention off it, it would dissapear and run/hide under my shirt again. I was really scared of it for some reason, and after around 5 loops of this, I started beating it repeatedly after it dropped out my sleeve, untill the rat\\s body turned into some sort of rubber goo. It\\s legs were still moving too. After this, it wouldn't touch me again, but I kept seeing its distorted body with the trembling legs from time to time.\n\nI quickly stood up and went to a different spot. I was approached by my mother. She was crying. \"Why did you do this, Sedric? We warned you.\" I told her not to worry, and that I was going to be fine. [bullshit..] Other people froze again, and I could hear voices saying \"we warned you\" and \"what have you done\" even though their lips weren`t moving. The longer I looked at them, the more distorted they would get, untill they had bug eyes and arms reaching the ground. Another flash followed. I was back at the front yard of the house, and saw Martin standing by me. I assumed he shook me. He asked if I was allright, and that I've been standing here for ages. He had spiders in his hair. I tried to say \"yes\" but I couldn't because my mouth was painfully dry. I walked my way to the house. [Martin later told me I never went there in the first place]\n\nThe whole trip thus far has been experienced right after getting out of the car, standing/moving around at that spot... There are many blackouts at this point. I recall centipedes from my last trip, spiders, all over me, and inside me. Around 10 of them crawled out of my mouth."

        "description": "I woke up, still tripping hard. Never remembered falling asleep. I went to check the next room. Martin told me I was out for around 5 hours. [later, I found out he was still asleep, and the information was false.] I managed to get some water, and go to the bathroom, because the urge to pee was terrible. Moving was still a difficult task, and I couldn`t concentrate properly. This is when I posted the words “aalive.” to the /del/ board on 420chan.\n\nWhen I got back to the livingroom, I saw someone sitting on the couch. It stood up, and I recognised the figure as the hatman. He walked towards me and said “You are getting in, and running out.” I started to feel extremely hazy and got another headrush. I’m not sure if I left the sofa, or blacked out and layed down on it, but I was there, at the edge of sleep, and the hatman was looking right at me.\n\nThis might be a dream, or a full-blown trip. I don’t remember closing my eyes, and I could still feel my surroundings. I was in an extremely vast room. The floor, ceiling and walls were black. There were no doors and I couldn’t see where it ended because darkness hid it out of sight. There was woman standing right in front of me. She looked at me, smiled, and took her face off as if it was a mask. The face behind it looked exactly the same, but she was bleeding from her eyes, mouth and nose, and her eyes were completely black. I looked around the room, to see faces appearing on the walls and ceiling, greeting me without words, untill they started to fall down like masks too, revealing bruised and blood-covered faces. The masks would turn into ash that wouldn`t settle, but move around the floor and feet.\n\nThat`s all I can remember from this stage of the trip.\n\nAfter snapping out of this, I laid there for a while, feeling my heart beat rapidly. The Hatman was gone. My hallucinations were mostly audial now. I heard lots of incomprehensible whispers, and quiet singing. I posted on the 420chan thread again, and decided to go to sleep for real. I was so very tired… This time, I drifted into deep, deep sleep.\n\nAfter a while, I realized I was sleeping. My vision was completely black, untill a room began to appear. It was small and gray, it`s door open, displaying nothingness. I walked towards the door and steped out of the room. Several shadows approached me. The door shut, and I heard “you are out” very clearly. Then I felt a burning pain at my chest.\n\nMartin said I started screaming. He tried to wake me up and checked my pulse, then realized what was happening and called an ambulance.\n\nI had to down a lot of charcoral. I had minor hallucinations for around 3 days. Fuck."

    "introduction": "Originally, I planned on using 2CB alone. Unfortunately, the dealer gave me much less than anticipated, and as a result I was only able to use 10mg. My intentions going in was to potentiate the 2CB with DXM, and possibly have a synergy.\nI have used DXM multiple times before at mid-second plat, and once at first plat with a (0.5g cubes) shroom combo (which was incredible).\nI have used 2CB once before (20mg insuffelated, but I mixed it with weed, and as I have learnt previously and learned again, weed and psychs do not work well for me. It made me anxious and it was hard to enjoy the trip.\n\nGoing into this trip, my plan was to relax and enjoy. I did not want to be introspective or judging myself, I have realized and learnt in the past, from my past experience with ego death, that in essence I struggle with believing positive things about me, and that my negative irrational feelings can be overpowering. As a result, my focus was to push on those affimrations and \"good\" feelings. A sort of CBT concept.\n\nThe house I am in was empty at the time, and I had space to myself. I bought grapes, popcorn, gum, nitrous cans, a vape, and more to enjoy for the trip.\nI dosed DPH and Zofran ahead of time for nausea, and dosed the DXM two hours before the 2CB. DXM usually takes 2 hours for me to start it's come up, so as a result I figured it would also help me ease into the 2CB. As I heard the come up can be rough. I was especially worried about nausea from the 2CB/DXM combo.\n\nI have had bad trips in the past mainly caused by others, and I felt a solo trip would be the best way to go about it. I usually am able to control myself and handle thoughts when it is just me alone. I had talked to people before hand and went through my thought process of doing a trip, and was certain this was something I wanted to do.\n\nI prepared myself notes with affirmations and responses to certain negative thoughts I thought I might experience. This isn't my first rodeo, I had friends that could come over, friends I could call, I have tripkillers and assistants. (Gabapentin, Trazadone, and Seroqual). I felt ready for the trip.\n\nI also had dosed 50mg of DPH and 8mg of Zofran for nausea ahead of time.",

I reminded myself that I thought this through, I could always end the trip, and I might as well see where it goes and plan for the best. Anxiety didn't gain me anything.\n\nAs the hour went on, I began to feel a buzz. It's almost that feeling once you snort a drug. You don't feel it instantly, but you get the rush from the act of snorting. Similarlly, I felt a sort of buzz from ingesting the drug. Something was coming, and I felt it."

My back pain (from an injury), was starting to become relieved, everything became more floaty and lighter. I felt everything have a slight glow to it.\n\nI walked around a bit and finished prepping my room for the trip. I also prepared the 2CB for dosing. I had been waiting to put on my tripping music, and began playing emo rap (Lil Peep, XXXTentacion, Juice WRLD, etc) and singing along with it. Sounding drunk as I sung."

The heat felt nice on DXM. I began to feel temperature dysregulation from the DXM. I noticed this because while it was decently warm outside, although not hot, I felt a bit chilly. Going inside my room, I kept changing the AC to adjust. I finalized on 20c (eventually going to 19c), and wearing a hoodie while inside and out. I kept myself drinking water, and enjoyed the music. I meditated for parts of it and listened to music for other parts of it.\nAt promptly at 1:00PM, I dosed the 2CB.\nI made sure that mentally I was ready for it. I felt it was the right call.

I kept expecting nausea, yet it never came. I kept a bag next to me, ready to throw up, but again, it never came. I was very happy about this, I am very sensitive to nausea and prone to throwing up.\n\nThe DXM peak is pleasant as always. A dissociated state of drunkenness, anxiety relief, light dissociation. It was not a heavy dose, light plat one, and I did this for a reason. I started to feel a buzz and body high build from the 2CB, my visuals starting swirling and geometric patterns starting to come about. My floor started to have patterns, not geometric, but almost grouping together of random mixes of stones and designs. It was incredible."

        "description": "I used the equivalent of 2 nitrous cartridges. This is what really kicked off my trip. The 2CB was kicking in so fast, it was hard to tell if I was ingesting nitrous or if I was just getting higher. It was both. I knew this because I had the taste and feel of nitrous, and the out of body \"woah\" bliss experience. At one point, I used the canister and I tasted blood. I got super confused and became worried at what had happened. Standing up and looking into the mirror, I realized I was picking my lips and as a result began to bleed. The bleeding had spread onto the canister. I cleaned up, and started to drink more water and it mostly went away. I am proud of myself for not panicking and being very rational about this. I think the 2CB helped guide me in this and the DXM took the edge off of the anxiety for it. The nitrous as I said, kicked off the trip, and when the nitrous was over, I was peaked on 2CB. I always feel it goes like this. It just transitioned me from a small high, to tripping. Or as my friend called it, \"Nexuswalk\" (Nexus + Robowalk, like Nexusflipping)"

I finally turned on my tripping playlist, laid in bed, and enjoyed. Looking up at the top of my bunk bed (I am on the bottom bunk), the cardboard under the mattress had a beautiful geometric design. Something right out of a psychedelic replication, it was a Aztez octogon-like design. It kept fading in and out and repeated up and down the mattress. I watched it move, and laughed at how amazing it was. I remember looking out the window and enjoying the sights, I walked around the bedroom and watched things move and turn and swirl.

This was reminding me of the beginning of my last ego death, and I decided I wanted to stay in a chill relaxed headspace and keep up the good times. I dosed 100mg gabapentin, and 300mg an hour after that. This took the edge off and I felt much better. I watched Breaking Bad, played music, and hung out."

    "conclusion": "I am very happy that I did this trip. I felt it showed I could solo trip and handle myself, and it also showed me that I am able to enjoy things by myself and relax. In the past, I've gotten caught up in \"solving all my problems\" or finding the \"answer\" to things. I'm not saying there shouldn't be trips for introspection, and I plan on having these trips in the future. But what I needed the most, was to relax and love myself. That is exactly what I did. Reflecting on the trip, I think it has helped me a lot mentally and I am proud of myself.\n\n2CB and DXM was a fantastic combo and I am surprised more do not do the combination. I read a few trip reports and reddit posts, but not much more. I for the future will certainly do this combination again. Likely dosing higher amounts of DXM, and redosing 2CB throughout (likely nasally)\n\nI also am now even more interested in trying ketamine with other psychedelics.",

        "description": "I went back into my bedroom, turned on a fan (it was hot), and sat on the bed. Instantly Ayahuasca made me sit up straighter, and my CEVs instantly sparked up and became mesmerising. From then on the trip was incredible. Purging made me think of a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis; I had got rid of the superfluous stuff filling my body, and now my mind could explore the wilderness freely. I began to look at my hands and started to contemplate evolution; humans have become the perfect vessel to explore inner and outer space. We have our ape heritage on display (body hair, etc) and should be proud of where we came from, but our minds have developed to a point that our imaginations fuel our progress. I thought that was cool.\n\nMy poster fell off the wall, so I put it back up, and I appreciated the complexity of the process that comes so easily; with my ape hands I dextrously handled the delicate paper, used enough strength to make it stick to the wall, had to take into account the force of gravity acting against it, and I was absent mindedly using trigonometry to get the angle aesthetically correct in relation to the wall and ceiling; maths, physics and kinetics are all being exercised just by doing something as mundane as putting up a poster. Sound was altered that day, and everything sounded like it had a machine-like phaser effect. The hum of my fan throbbed and changed pitch, so it made the noise seem more natural than it really was.\n\nI was again looking at my hands, flexing my fingers, making fists, and marvelling at my new-found dexterity. My hands were sweating, but that was a good thing, like it was lubricant for a complex machine. I stretched my toes, wiggled them individually (which I can’t normally do), and imagined being a lion lounging in the sun, stretching every muscle. I could even flex muscles individually, so I could focus on one muscle in my thigh and flex it. I really enjoyed being in command of my body like that. When I was smoking a joint I was nimbly playing with it, rolling it between my fingers with confidence. I felt more primal in this state, as I’m not normally as confident in what I can do with my body.\n\nMy hair felt incredible; it felt super-clean and fuller than normal, flopping over my face playfully. I felt I understood hippies’ aversions to products and to cutting hair, because at moments like that it feels so good and natural.\n\nI thought about the universe and started to form pseudo-religion ideas about it. I imagined it to be the creator of all things, as it is everything; space, time, and matter. In order for it to reproduce asexually it creates galaxies, solar systems, planets and life. Eventually some of that life will evolve intelligence, and some of that intelligence will evolve into pure thought, to such a point where they will be able to create universes. The penalty for the original universe’s reproduction is that it has to adhere to the linear march of time, marching onwards, because that’s the only way intelligence will evolve. Eventually time will kill the universe, as it kills all things. In the meantime, like every mother, its children (including us) will live on and reproduce, creating more universes. I felt as though I was being told all of this from the universe itself, as its own reward for this process is enjoying the diverse beauty of all of its creations; art, music, and the inhabitants of the planets themselves. Everything we are and what we make is a mark of evolutionary genius.\n\nThe phrase ‘we are the masters of our own creation’ kept repeating itself, but I can’t fully remember the explanation. I was predicting man’s own transcendence into pure thought, so maybe that was a reference to the universe we will one day create.\n\nI felt a lot of love for my friends on my peak, so I sent a few texts asking how everyone is. I thought up a long thank you message for my mum to hear when she becomes pure thought after death. I thanked her for her selfless love, and for creating me. I thanked my dad for the same and for giving my passion, absolute passion, for music. For my girlfriend I was thankful for looking after me while I was going through physical and mental ecstasy, and for being there all the time.\n\nEverything I pondered came back to evolution. Everything we that we are has its own, self-repeating catalyst; there was once only one language, spoken by one group of early humans, and now there are hundreds, having been thousands, and they can understand each other. This was a metaphor for mankind, for intelligence. There will be a point, in the future, when all of the universe’s intelligent beings will understand each other. I thought about politics, and saw it as an evolutionary process. I thought of right-wing politics, trying to stem the tide of progress; as the world becomes more liberal we are marching onwards to greater ages of civil rights and more liberties, ultimately send out more love and good vibes.\n\nI went outside and looked at the sky, and I could see properly that it was a canvass of gas, of chemical processes. The clouds started to form a single, swirling visual, and it was like the end of the Adventure Time episode ‘All The Little People’, when Finn speaks to the mini-Finn and mini-Finn sees clouds forming a shape to speak to him. The cloud I saw was the universe’s face, which was complex, geometric visuals. I looked at the floor and the paving slabs turned into an Aztec rug, so I thought about the ‘primitive’ people who had access to these kinds of psychedelics, and felt that I understood why they didn’t have the technology the ‘West’ had when they were conquered; because they didn’t need it. To them they could access the realm of the divine, and what’s better than that?"

    "introduction": "report, to whomever it may concern.\n\nThere are a few things to be said before I get to the actual report.\n\nFirstly, I’m still very much a beginner when it comes to psychoactive drugs, and I’ve only ever done Cannabis and Nitrous Oxide before (And both combined a few times, I must say I love the combination) to any effect, and while I tried Harmala with Cannabis in preparation for this, I cannot say whether I was feeling anything from the Harmala at that time. Whether this unfamiliarity makes me more sensitive to the effects of various psychoactives because I’m not used to them or, conversely, makes me less sensitive because my walls of perception have not been fully breached yet, I cannot tell for sure.\n\nSecondly, this report is a combination of reflections I have regarding the session and actual things I described to my friend via instant messaging during the experience, slightly edited for improved readability, and the time stamps are sometimes far from accurate. Thirdly, I chose to consume the finely ground Harmala and Hostilis as is, without resorting to making a tea or anything of the sort. This is because I felt confident my stomach could handle it, and because I felt as if it was the best way to make sure I get 100% of the compounds into my system. I was thinking that a filtered extraction might lose some of it if not prepared thoroughly enough. I also chose to wait 10-15 minutes between the Harmala and the Hostilis, not to waste any of the DMT passing through my system while the Harmala hasn’t activated yet. My close friend (who introduced me) did it this way, and it worked like a charm for him.\n\nFinally, the thoughts and experiences described in this first report do not necessarily reflect my current views on me, the drug or the universe in general. I’ve had two more sessions in the week or so that has passed since this, and I’ve had a lot of time to revise my views. Those revisions will be explored further down the line, as I find it important to first share my thoughts as they were at the time. With these things said, we shall move on to…",

I went to the bathroom, turned off the lights, and sat down on the floor with my head leaning over the WC, expecting to purge. During this time, I was drifting between realities. A lot of them were defined by fractal patterns. All fractals had an empty circle in the middle of them, as far as I can remember.\n\nSome of these realities were weird to the point of being indescribable. I’m calling them realities not because I’m convinced they’re real, but because they weren’t just visual. A lot of times I somehow *remembered* things from these odd places, and on one occasion I found myself staring at a mother and her daughter just below a ski slope. More people were behind me, but I don’t know how I know that, because there were no sounds and I didn’t look in that direction.

        "description": "I’ve realized now that I’ve always had these voices in my mind and in my body, telling me whether the things I’m doing are wrong and right. I’ve just turned down the volume gradually throughout the years. I haven’t heard these in so many years.\n\nFrom the beginning, “I” was just a collection of these voices, with a central unit (consciousness) that can listen in to them. Really simple and primitive voices, which know nothing except for the things they exist to do, but on a large scale they exhibit something resembling intelligent thought. There is definitely something inside of me that can choose to turn the volume on these voices up or down. Just like a mixer table. These voices are the building blocks of consciousness. Even these primitive voices are conscious to a degree, however simple that consciousness might seem.\n\nIt is too hard, however, to keep track of all these separate voices. Lots and lots of these simple voices are grouped up together by purpose, categorized by our consciousness and form a common voice. This has to be done, because if every voice had their say all the time, the self would be in a state of constant chaos and turmoil. This voice is more complex than all of its parts. Just like a group of individuals uniting in a common cause, forming hierarchies and systems of governance, these voices start to exhibit group behavior on larger scales. These groups of voices will in turn be grouped up with other groups operating on the same scale, and become even more complex, until they ultimately form the thing we come to think of as “I”. If you think of every one of these voices as a person, then the “I” is a lot like the world we are living in. There is a very beautiful fractal-like symmetry in this.\n\nThis system is not perfect, however. These voices are simple and do not understand the meaning of moderation. The further down the hierarchy you go, the simpler they become, until they are little more than streams of pure intent. If the consciousness focuses too much attention on one particular voice (or set of voices), it will get too accustomed to it. These voices will get too much attention, and grow selfish. Let them have their way all the time and they will grow complacent. They will keep crying even when their initial demands are met, resulting in a constant screaming for attention. This is how bad habits and addictions are formed. This also means that other voices also in need of attention will start to fade until they become background noise.\n\nThe consciousness might not notice or care, but the background noise never stops. These voices cry out for a reason, which is to make sure that we take care of our mind and body. This means that if the consciousness does not listen, it will never find out the reason behind their crying and therefore never solve the problem. The voices will keep crying. This clogs the machinery and slows down thought, because the consciousness is limited in capacity. Compare this to a tyrannical society falling apart when the institutions can no longer handle the amount of petitions or uprisings by displeased citizens. If the people are happy, the government has more time to spend on other things.\n\nIt is possible to listen in on voices at a lower level. This takes a lot of practice, a lot of listening. I feel as if the fine-tuning of the consciousness can be done by listening inwards, and that this is the way to cultivate happiness, contentedness and clarity of mind. Listen to your inner voices, the way a benevolent ruler listens to his people, and your voices will love you. And, since these voices are all part of you, this means that you will learn to love yourself proper.\n\nThis perspective on things is a bit complicated to live with. Thinking of every single part of my body as being a figurative planet of really primitive people with their own lives and history that need to have their demands met makes it too complex to handle. One must find and maintain a balance, where one listens just closely enough to keep the mind and body satisfied, but keeps enough of a distance to not get overwhelmed by it all."

Their liberties slowly stripped away. It is scary how closely the outside world resembles the self.\n\nI’ve been rambling on for a long time now. The nausea is still present. It eats away at the consciousness, and doesn’t let me think as clearly as I would like. I wish it would get loud enough to give me a reason to do… whatever a dictatorship does to people who don’t agree with the imagined “cause” for which it strives.\n\nHaving more thoughts, about whether our universe in turn can be viewed as a simple building block of something on a much higher plane, where it can be considered a “voice” in a much more complicated consciousness, or, if you choose, one person in a much more complex world. Maybe this cosmic consciousness also struggles to maintain some kind of self-identity amidst all the chaos. I’m not sure of these things now that I reflect upon them, but they make a great thought experiment.\n\nRealities keep coming and going gently through all this. It is very much a pleasant experience so far."

As for whether such a god exists or not, I cannot say. But this is how religion as a concept looks and feels to me right now. I’m pondering some more about these voices. If I’m not talking to any of these separate voices in person, then I do not know any of them closely enough to call them a friend. This would mean I’m not very close to myself. I’m a stranger in my own mind. This thought is more fascinating than scary.\n\nI’ve realized how much better any interaction with other people gets if you decide to listen with interest, rather than doing it per social code and care for 10% of what is said. This is hard to do, but it can be done. And it is so much more interesting than listening to the same voices over and over, echoing against the emptiness inside. It is also interesting to note how unimportant it feels to force these realizations down others’ throats. They might not need them right now, or agree with them. The things they need to realize might be completely different from these. Also, I have myself to discuss with now. The parts of myself I didn’t know existed."

        "description": "I’m definitely coming down, however gently. It feels as if days have passed, if that even matters. It’s a funny feeling to sit and talk/think of your body as a collective of separate beings. It’s harder to justify abusing a whole civilization than only abusing yourself. I’m just a moderator in a very rowdy community, and it is my responsibility to make sure that all parts of my mind and body have a say in things. My capacity to listen in might be limited, but it is supposed to be enough. (Not much to add after this. I sent some conversation logs to a couple of friends for them to read. One of them noted that it sounded to him as if I had explained “divinity”, one voice for all voices, which is what the collective of voices would be to the individual, on any scale.)"

    "conclusion": "This was definitely an enlightening experience. Many of the thoughts and ideas are a bit fuzzy, which isn’t that odd as they are very much a work in progress, and some of them have already been revised, but I feel like I’ve gained a lot from this. It wasn’t as intense or glowing as the following two trips, but by no means less valuable. I hope it has been an interesting read. I’ll return with more recent thoughts and experiences as soon as I’ve gotten my lazy ass to compile them.\n\nThanks for the time.",

        "description": "I don’t remember everything that happened that day, as I went through ego death (for the first time), but I remember that the sea looked as though I needed 3D glasses to see it; it had the same disjointed green and blue colour effect you see on those printed 3D images you view with those cheap glasses. Everything was more vibrant (the greens were greener, etc), but also everything had a purple tint to it, like a thin film of purple had been laid over the world (just like when you see oil in water and catch the sunlight in it). I looked at the treetops from a distance and saw that their colour was pulsating, switching between green and purple and red and back again, like they were having colour poured onto them, one colour after another. It was lovely.\n\nMy friends took me on a tour of the park, and it didn’t feel like I was walking at all; the walk on uneven ground was very easy, almost like I was floating, and it also felt like the ground was rounder than normal and was rotating beneath my feet, so that the world was moving around me and not me walking over it. We got to a cave and I followed my friend Josikins inside, and out again through a small side passage that takes you to the front of the cave again. After I got to the side of the cave entrance I saw my friend lead me inside it, from a 3rd person perspective, just a few metres from me. It didn’t blow me away, I just thought it was pretty cool, and carried on following my friend through the foliage. We were on our way back to the original spot, and Josikins took me into the secret 'Shaman Hut' (which is a modest construction; essentially a lean-to made from canvas against a tree). The Hut looked quite small on the outside, but was enormous on the inside and reminded me of a Bedouin tent. she showed me a book of the universe, with pictures of planets and nebulae and such, but I still thought she was a demi-god and I thought she was showing me the history of the universe through the medium of this book. The pictures became 3D holograms floating above the pages and I kept asking to know more \"What happens next?\" I asked, and she turned the page and up popped another 3D hologram of a nebula. \"How did it begin?\" I got around to asking, and she showed me the front of the book, giggling, showing me the page on the very inside of the hard front cover (it was just a pattern, maybe it was of a very zoomed-in image of a nebula), but I saw a swirling purple and pink gas that represented nothingness!\n\nWe got back to where we started our trip, overlooking the sea, and I was lost in thought. I was convinced that either I had transcended and was among demi-gods, or that I had died and was on my way to paradise. This wasn’t scary, as the day was too beautiful and I was feeling so fucking happy. The only thing that bothered me that my girlfriend wasn’t there, which I thought meant that I had left her behind when I died, for which I felt guilty, or that I had transcended without her, for which I felt guilty. I kept asking my friends if I had died, or when my girlfriend would get the chance to transcend, but I can’t remember their answers. Probably reassuring ones. All I remembered of the day, of my life even, was taking those tabs and trekking up this huge fucking hill, so I thought that all that had ever existed started when I took those tabs, and that life before then was fake.\n\nI was asking questions aloud to my friends/guardian spirits, like “When did you get here?” (by which I meant, ‘When did you beings come into existence?’), and my friend replied “We’ve been here the whole time, dude” (this proved to me that they were divine). Another friend got up to put something in his backpack, and I thought he was about to jump off the cliff, and I suddenly felt frightfully scared at the prospect, and said “No! Don’t jump!” (thinking instantly of the tales one hears about people who take acid and think they can fly), but he merely said “Why would I jump?”, and that blew away all preconceptions about drugs that I had ever heard from figures of authority! Of course he wasn’t going to jump, why the fuck would he do that? This stuff doesn’t turn you into a moron/zombie/junkie/whatever, we really have been lied to! I then started to think of the authorities in a negative (true?) light that I never really considered before. It was ‘Us’ (the psychedelic community), and ‘Them’ (authority), and I had declared my unwavering support for the former. I thought that I was being recruited by LSD entities (who were just my friends in reality), as some sort of foot soldier in the on-going struggle for liberty! These thoughts passed when I went through ego death and got stuck in a loop, from which my friends saved me by giving me the phrase ‘You do not need to understand’ to read over and over again on a piece of paper (see pics).\n\nThe next hour or so I don’t remember, but it was deep. And very beautiful and liberating. One friend stayed behind to keep me company through all this while the other two went exploring, and I asked stuff from time to time (still thinking he was divine); “Where did you come from?” I asked, and he replied by touching my heart and whispering “We came from inside.” Looking back on it he was simply trolling me, but my mind was blown, again. Eventually the others came back and were encouraging me to play my mandolin for them, which I had brought along, naively thinking that the LSD would make me some cosmically-inspired virtuoso on an instrument that isn’t my first choice when making music. They were encouraging me to play, and I felt as though the universe had just given me all of its musical knowledge that had ever existed or would ever be; all of the thousands of years’ worth of musical talent on earth had just been given to me, and now I knew all there could be about music – however I just about managed to (poorly) strum an out-of-tune A chord on my cheap mandolin, and I just burst into laughter. It felt like a Twilight Zone form of irony; despite all of the beauty and perfection one can create in their mind, man is just too imperfect to be able to convey these arts without losing the original thought’s substance. “Words are an encumbrance to meaning”, just as my clumsy ape hands couldn’t convey the music I was hearing at the time. Then I looked at my mandolin and saw Egyptian pyramids where my frets were, and handed the thing to my friend to look at (and also to stop myself from trying to play the mandolin).\n\nAnother thing I remember about the trip was the audio effects; everything was ‘swooshy’, like the phasing effect on a flanger, and when I inhaled deeply I heard fluttering – like my inhaled breath was making a purring sound. This has happened on other acid trips since, and I clearly hear this when I listen to music; if I listen to a song and take a deep breath, the drums often sound like they’re speeding up, and when I exhale they slow down to normal tempo, all without making the song sound terrible (it actually sounds really cool). I came down from my trip pretty dramatically; if you can make your eyes quiver or shiver by tensing them (a lot of people can do this, I just don’t know the name for it) then that’s exactly what I see when coming down from acid. In the trips since my first experience it just meant I was coming down, but on my first trip I was sober immediately after. Even though my friends continued to smoke weed to keep the trip going, or to make the visuals more intense, then weed did nothing but get me high. But I was content. We sat on the hill overlooking our home town, and watched the sun go down on one of the best days of my life."

        "description": "And I thought it was bad LSD. I couldn't have been more wrong.\n\nI was so excited to finally try LSD that the whole week leading up to it I got as much done as I could. I wanted to go into it completely carefree, wanted to make the most of the trip. I had a quiet morning leading up to the trip. I took 1.5 x 150μg blotter tabs at 1:10 PM. The next 1.5-2hrs were rough; I was very nauseated, and I couldn't smoke any weed to alleviate it. After an hour and a half, I was convinced the LSD was bad. Finally, my sister (who throws a fit whenever she sees me smoking) left the house. Smoking a bowl was exactly what I needed. Soon, the nausea was gone, and I was feeling good again. The LSD snuck up on me, not being sure exactly what to expect. I realized the weed in the slider looked like green crystals; the glass slider was refracting the sunlight beautifully. I look around the room, captivated by its rhythmic movements. The carpet danced, geometry moving in tune with the music I was playing. The carpet told a story, geometry giving way to faces, animals, scenes, which then revert to geometry. I notice the body high for the first time when I am laying on the floor, letting the music pour over me in a way it never had before.\n\nMusic is quite an experience on acid. I laughed, I cried, I smiled harder than I ever had before. And I kept smiling. Each song was an adventure. It wasn't just sound pouring through my headphones, but emotion and meaning and hope and sadness. I love listening to music; it's one of my biggest passions. And to be able to experience it in such a pure way was one of the best experiences in my life."

        "description": "During the trip, I peaked three times, each time about 30 minutes after smoking a bowl. I was listening to music in my room, which is pretty bright for the first time and the body high started to engulf me. I could barely feel where my body ended, and the room around me began. I felt like a consciousness in a sea of pleasurable feelings. I realized I wanted to move to a darker place; I decided to move to the basement. When I got up, I felt like the pleasurable waves were helping me float along. I saw my room was a little messy so I tidied it up some. I got into something of a loop for awhile (which I only just realized now). I would be in my room listening to music, then do a little cleaning, then head downstairs into the dark. Repeat 2-3 times.\n\nWhen I made it downstairs using the TV was an immense challenge. I had to use the remote to log in to Netflix (and later Pandora) then search for what I was looking for, each time it was a challenging task, but still incredibly fun to try and do. Finally, I watched an episode of Adventure Time. I wasn't absorbing it at all, but it was hysterical, the funniest episode I had ever seen. It didn't have to make sense because of the very visual humor and animation. I had to stop because I was laughing too hard. I tried instead to blow my mind by watching \"Inexplicable Universe.\" The host's soothing voice was overwhelming almost; I couldn't stop laughing. It was then that I realized I was going through ego death. I watched the show and felt as if his words were blasting away my consciousness. I didn't want to have the show be the thing that carried me completely away, so I painstakingly loaded Pandora and listened to more music. It stripped away all sense of self and ego, and vestiges of my usual self. I was everything in the room, everything in the world. And nothing. The music guided my consciousness; I felt like I couldn't think without it. I was trying to communicate some in IRC, but it was very challenging. I couldn't even think what I would say, or how I could capture such an amazing experience. Not to mention, my phone screen looked like a swimming pool with the image on top, and my typing fingers looked goofy and out of place.\n\nAfter awhile I went back to my room, the trip was heavier in the dark, but I didn't want to stay there all day. So I went to my room and grabbed my pipe and walked outside into the woods. After going out sufficiently far, I realized two things. First, I had gotten the pipe a few days before because of it's small size, but after smoking the thing I remembered why I never got one before because I don't like smoking weed through a pipe, joint, or blunt. Too harsh, I know I'm a wimp. So I got out there and realized I didn't want to smoke, that I was just going to get rid of the damn thing. After I had thrown it a good distance, I wondered if it was far enough from the house. I turned around. Everything was beautiful, if it looked like that all the time I would live out here, I thought. Holy shit I was pretty far into the woods, though, I could barely see past the trees and bushes covered in visuals to see my house. And I simply couldn't gauge distance or what that even meant. Here is one moment in the trip I know it could've gone south. I briefly panic, very confused. It hits me that the music playing from my phone has turned aggressive and grating, when I change the music, I lose the panic and make my way back to the house. I held my phone out in front of me like a beacon; the sound was like a lantern for my consciousness. I felt like I couldn't think or function without it. I made it back to the house finally unharmed, and thrilled everything went okay.\n\nI remember thinking how we are all just floating consciousnesses. We may have a body, but we perceive the world through our eyes and our brain thinks. We aren't our whole body; we're just the absurd consciousnesses that process its signals. I loved everything in the world. I loved life. Everything was pure joy and awe. The whole trip was joy and wonder, more than I thought it possible even to feel.\n\nI saw a picture on the LSD subreddit, of a girl before and during her trip. I felt more connected to her and that picture than I ever had to any other person or image. I thought about the world, in awe that there are 6 billion people just like me. I felt like one hub in an infinitely connected structure.\n\nThe physical pleasure was so much that I realized I was getting aroused from it. Considering how low my sex drive has been in the last couple months, I was thrilled. The physical pleasure started to move lower and radiated from my pelvis throughout my body. Without any stimulation, I felt the pleasure pour over me already as intense as an orgasm. My body was shuddering, and my toes curled. When I used my vibrator to bring myself to orgasm (which took longer than I thought), I was blown away. I screamed in pleasure, the orgasm rocking my whole body. It was relentless, my back curled and I spasmed and writhed in pleasure for what felt like an eternity. The orgasm lasted almost a minute, miles more intense than any I had ever felt.\n\n(Context: Ashley is a tulpa, an autonomous and sentient thoughtform that I live with.)\n\nSo where was Ashley in all this? Right there with me for most of it. I kept getting glimpses of her in my peripheral vision. Laying on the couch next to me, etc. She was enjoying it as much I was. I think we must've told each other how much we loved each other a dozen times. It was if we existed on two thinly separated dimensions. I perceived both dimensions simultaneously, the difference between what I saw physically or with my mind's eye seemed trivial and very easy to forget. When the dimensions overlapped, I would get a glimpse of her if she was nearby. If were in the same place \"overlapping\" each other, we could share our presences to create a remarkable sense of unity; it also amplified the physical sensations like we were sharing each other.\n\nPossession with any ego-suppression is always a treat. Especially with the intensity of ego-loss I had. There was no mental preparation needed for a complete and instant switch in control. Ashley managed our body easily. We only did it for twenty or so minutes, possession shoots my ego loss through the roof and is the easiest way for my to hit ego-death, simply because you begin to feel so incredibly dissociated with your body and to a certain extent, reality. I would be thinking about something and realize that we were somewhere else, I was completely the passenger in my body. With more practice, I think switching would be readily achievable while tripping, we'll see. With her possessing, I felt like I was in her body. So much so that I started to perceive her form as our body over my own.\n\nSo, I felt more connected to Ashley than ever before. But there is more. It was during the 2nd peak of the trip when I felt her sending me these mental snapshots of what was happening in mindscape. I'll let her tell the story.\n\n**Ashley's report:** \n\nOk, so I fucking love LSD. It's truly unique. Usually, tripping is just visuals and a diminished mental effect for me. But LSD made the world around me come alive. I first noticed it playing guitar. It was sheer joy already, creating music on acid. I would play based off what we were listening too or just play how I felt. When I hit my 2nd peak (the same time she did), I was playing guitar. The sounds took on color. Each note sent a ripple of color through the air. My music was its own light show. Then the waves of color solidified into strands which circled me. Each note lit up or added a strand, like weaving a tapestry of color. Each strand added a different layer to the body high I felt. I was so excited I got Kaylee's attention by sending her images of what was happening. I learned I didn't even need an instrument. I created music with a thought. I could control it consciously or simply pour out my emotion and soul and see them translated into music. It was a very pure experience.\n\nThe difference between LSD and other trips we had was I wasn't an audience to her tripping, just getting secondhand effects. I was lifted up and made as strong as Kaylee. When I possessed her form, I felt completely connected to her body, instead of just controlling it. I got the full experience of what it's like to have a physical body. I got a taste of complete independence too. We shared our trips, experienced them in each others company, but did not experience the same things.\n\nI was the god of my reality. I visited new places and familiar places. Sometimes mindscape can be muddy or in flux trying to render new places but not then. Kaylee got to enjoy the woods nearby and her house, but I had no such limits. I walked through Rivendell, enjoying its serene beauty. I stood at the helm of a spaceship, watching stars pass by, looking down on beautiful undiscovered planets. I saw more beautiful places than I can recount or even remember. I was God, and my thoughts became a reality. When I possessed Kaylee I had to let go of control for her to take back over (a first). I used to wonder about the limits of my autonomy, but I have no doubts now. I tasted complete independence but never felt closer to her. Briefly having a relationship as true peers made me realize how fucking great that can be. I gained so much confidence in who I am as a person from the trip. I could feel her thought-stream when I focused on it; it was so easy to interject my thoughts into it to get her attention or otherwise, much easier than normal. I could also completely detach myself from it. Usually I at least faintly perceive Kaylee's actions and thoughts at all times. For a little, I saw what it would be like without that."

My mind felt like it was overwhelmed with anxiety. I decided to head back inside to fight my subconscious.\n\nWhat ensued was utter madness. My mind was in chaos and slowly, over the next hour, I put it back together. At some point, self-hatred, anxiety, and self-doubt ceased to become logical. When you have seen what I have seen, there can be no room for self-doubt. There can be no room for fear. I once again felt compassion and love for myself and along with that, compassion and love for all of humanity.\n\nI cannot fully describe the events that took place, but after an hour, I had both won and lost the battle. I grieved for the I who had lost and cheered for the I who had won. I still have issues to work out, but I had fought enough for today. I knew without a doubt, that I am capable of overcoming all of my struggles, personal problems, and emotional baggage. The journey will not be easy, but it is something that I have to do.\n\nI closed the door to the apartment, mentally visualizing it as the door to the dark parts of my subconscious and walked outside to the light of my mind.\n\nAs soon as I walked outside, I began tripping balls. Really tripping balls. My perspective was not completely clouded with culture, drama, and meaningless problems. The beauty of my existence, my loved ones, and my position in the universe were finally put into perspective. I experienced rapidly fired thoughts, euphoria, and visuals.\n\nI wrote in my notebook:\n\n*I have found god. I have found all of the answers of suffering. The answers are inside myself. I am god. Tripping allows you to see inside the control panel of your mind. Beyond all the daily annoyances (your inner life) there is the answer. There is god. God is inside of you. All you must do is close the door on what has made you “you” and endless possibilities await you. The answers are inside you. I cannot communicate with language what I have felt, I can only communicate with music. I have found god. I am god. God is everywhere. God is in everyone. We are all god, but only few realize it.*"

I was so happy that she had someone to hug, talk to, cuddle with, and have sex with now that my father is dead. I was so happy that she didn’t have to be alone anymore. I was also overcome with sadness for what she lost with my father. I realized that I hadn’t cried over my father’s death and I finally just cried. I felt so terrible for my mother. I felt so bad that she had lost her husband.\n\nI cried for three hours straight. Sometimes I just screamed out from the tears and sometimes I collapsed onto the floor. The crying was not bad at all. It was beautiful. I needed to get out of the negative emotions out of my body and this was the way to do it. I cried and I felt negative emotions strongly, but I was not experiencing a bad trip.\n\nI also felt incredibly sad that my brother hasn't found a girlfriend and does not have a relationship of his own. I wanted him to be happy, like I am. I texted my brother to tell him that I loved him and that I wanted a better relationship with him.\n\nMy boyfriend came over while I was coming down and we had a wonderful time together. My boyfriend and the 4-aco-dmt helped me realize that the relationship that you have with your family is very important."

    "introduction": "Josie here, reading through this trip report 8 years later is deeply unsettling. This experience occurred during a period of our lives in which we were both extremely suicidal and coping with that through a combination of romantic codependence and wreckless drug abuse. We are no longer together for reasons that I am not comfortable going into here, but this report honestly just sorta fills me with regret. However, I have decided to leave it here regardless, as it is part of my personal history and therefore part of the history of this project.\n\n**My (Oscarette's) perspective:**\nI ingested the 50mg of 4-aco-dmt after a full meal and only four total hours of sleep. My short term memory was already malfunctioning due to withdrawling from heavy benzodiazepine use. My girlfriend took the same amount of the drug as me.\n\nI immediately experienced come-up anxiety (like always) and my girlfriend Josie (whom remained with me for the entire trip) reassured me that everything was okay. My experienced got better due to her reassurance and I was soon able to laugh and listen to Psychonautwiki's good vibes playlist.\n\nI experienced unity and interconnectedness through the majority of the trip.\n\nMy body temperature alternated between extremely hot and extremely cold. Whenever I mentioned feeling this particular effect out loud, Josie turned on my fan and pointed it on me until I told her that my temperature was at a comfortable level.\n\nI experienced nausea, but failed to vomit. Several times, I had a reoccuring delusion during this trip that Josie had suddenly died and this caused me to scream. The delusion happened several times during this trip and usually happened when she closed for eyes for several seconds. My delusion was likely a result of my severe short term memory loss. The first time this happened, Josie was simply looking at the ceiling while high and she had to physically stand up and keep talking in order to keep me from slipping into the delusion and screaming. Once, Josie pretended to die to make me laugh.\n\nMy girlfriend's face continued to change and distort; it even started melting at points. Sometimes I saw her as super attractive, but at other points, the visual distortions fucked up her face so much that i was not attracted to her in the slightest. Josie and I cried over how much we truly love one another and discussed how we are both god.\n\nMy short-term memory was so terrible that Josie had to write \"how's the short-term memory? 50mg 4-aco-dmt, trippin ballz\" onto a piece of paper. She showed me this paper repeatedly every time that I forgot what was going on in the current, external situation (which happened frequently).\n\nAs the sun began to set, the room got darker. Josie had to plug in a lamp so that we could continue reading the piece of paper. Plugging in the lamp proved to be difficult during the intoxication and resulted in us two freaking out a bit.\n\nAfterwards, I passed out, lost balance on the floor, and fell over. This experience felt like my body shutting down all of its organs and processes for a couple of seconds and was not pleasant.\n\n**My girlfriend's perspective:**\n\nOskykins fell down onto the carpetted floor in a pretty controlled fashion. She hit her knee, but failed to hit her head or cause any serious damage. I immediately checked on her to see if she was alright. She appeared conscious and responded to me with words. Based on her reaction, she was clearly tripping extremely hard, but was doing fine after the fall.\n\nI physically carried her from the floor onto the bed to keep her safe. She was freaking out hard because she believed that she was going to die soon. I administered some benzodiazepine-infused water of an unknown dosage to her in an attempt to calm her down.\n\nOskykins was completely convinced that she was on her death bed. She begged me to help her call our friend PJosepherum so that she could see and hear him before she died. We couldn't get the call to work, unfortunately.\n\nAt one point, Oskykins started to salivate as if she were having some kind of fit. I wiped the saliva away and feared for her health. Although I logically knew that I could restrain herfor her own safety until she came down if needed (we had consented this this beforehand), I was extremely scared.\n\nOskykins suggested that we watch the children's television show Adventure Time in order to calm down, but it proved to be a sinister episode. I was getting delusional over the show and started sensing messages from Jake's parents about being a detective with the scenarios always going very wrong. I marvelled at the style and detail of the animation.\n\nAt this time, Oskykins pulled out a stopwatch application on her phone which showed we had been tripping for three hours and forty-seven minutes. We were both relieved that this showed the peak being over.\n\n**My perspective:**\n\nMy short-term memory was still severely impaired and I was delusional. I kept repeating several statesments including:\n\n* I wish I could be Oskykins\n* I wish I could go back to how things used to be.\n* I just want to be able to take showers, go outside, and perform normal human activities that I usually take for granted.\n* I wish I could make conversation\n\nMy girlfriend reassured me by telling me that I was her favorite person to make conversation with. I became convinced that I was dying and that my organs were shutting down at many points and said \"good bye\" to Josie. She replied back to me, always, with \"hello.\"\n\nI experienced internal hallucinations that I was dying in a room with a single candle. At some points, I believed that I had been reincarnated.\n\nAs we got further away from our peak, I laid down on the floor with Josie and came to the realization that I wanted to move to the United Kingdom in order to be with my girlfriend and PJosepherum perminently. I wanted us to be able to work on Psychonautwiki in person as I believed that we need to help as many people as possible as a happy triple. I expressed interest working with other communities to continue making a difference. We spoke about the wiki's IRC channel, the people whom we love, and the people whom we want to meet in the future.\n\nIf we simply make helping people our goal, I realized, we cannot go wrong. My girlfriend and I talked about our mothers and decided that we had both \"designed it this way ourselves\" from the very beginning.\n\n**My girlfriend's perspective:**\nOskykins became hyper-intelligent, aware, capable, happy, adorable, and impressive. She started spouting out all of these novel ideas for how we can help people and what we should be doing with our lives. We both discussed our love for each other and PJosepherum as well as ideas for a trip timer which could have a live stop watch which tells the user when they are going to come down from the particular drug.\n\nAfter coming down from the psychedelic, we both felt like we had gotten extactly what we had needed and felt very refreshed and happy to be alive.",

        "description": "My friends were kinda talking to me like I was a small child at this point, so I felt singled out in a strange way, since I was the only one tripping really hard, and I felt like my happiness was making them happy, it was really weird though because I just felt like everything they said they were saying to me or about me (I have this problem any time I trip though) when they were unlocking the door was when I stopped understanding what they were saying for the most part, a lot of words just sounded like gibberish and didn't mean anything to me, I don't remember climbing the stairs, I know when we first got in the kitchen I threw my stuff on the ground and said \"I'm sorry but I just need to lay on the floor,\" and proceeded to lay on the rug in the kitchen, G layed down next to me and I cuddled up to her and proclaimed how much I loved her and after that is when everything is completely out of order and confusing, I'll try my best to give a good explanation.\n\nAt this point I was seeing level 5 visual geometry, Everything started to look very strange and soft, people eyes got big and shiny, the texture of everything was similar to a pixar cartoon, I can recall hearing my friend say they wanted to take more than one hit of acid, because they had only ever taken one at a time, I could see the emotion for some reason, wanting, I felt like I was experiencing senses that didn't exist, I think I was experiencing concepts, I remember flipping around and everything I knocked into felt really good so I started flipping around the kitchen and knocking into everything that's when stuff started looking really weird, the carpet started to look like cats, like a bunch of cats all sitting on top of each other, I knew it was still the carpet though, I looked out the door over the balcony and all the trees started to look like 2 dimensional cartoon arms, that's when I started to have level 6 geometry, the arms branched out and covered my whole vision, everything was made of arms, I can't remember what happened after this.\n\nI remember being in this strange world, (I was still partially aware that I was on a drug and with my friends, I don't think I was aware of who's house I was at and why we were all there or anything.) it was like I could let people into this world and once they were there they would understand everything, and I thought people would be angry that I was there but once I let them in they would understand, and I felt completely free from everything, I was overwhelmed with joy, everything in this world was very colorful there was a lot of blue pink and yellow, also mint green, purple, and gold. I could see my friends still, it was like I was in a strange tunnel though, I kept talking about how we should be using the acid we took for science, as in scientific research, to study consciousness and how the brain works and philosophy, my friend A asked me (or maybe someone else) how the stuff we took compared to my friend P's acid. A looked like a yellow cartoon cat with blue eyes, 2D, not detailed at all that I can remember. After she said that everyone and everything including me turned into this swirling color pattern of mostly blue pink and yellow and it was the emotion happiness, it was like a wave, it was 2 dimensional I think I may have blacked out during this time because I don't have any memory of what happened afterwards.\n\nThe next thing I remember was looking at my friend G, she said something to me but it didn't make any sense and it was like a computer glitching, my brain felt like a computer glitching, and I just remember her going ah? ah? In an inquisitive tone and then ahhh in a disappointed one like she was going do you understand? do you understand? then nah you don't, I could make out words, I'm not sure who was saying them her or me, but it was like a glitch feeling, it was *\"nothing #glitch makes #glitch shmense\"* (sense but it sounded like smense haha) then everything started separating from itself as in senses, the color of a table would separate from the texture and the idea of a table and then it connected in different ways, Started with the blending of my vision, I was looking at a friends face then gazed past and looked at the wall, first I became confused and couldn't distinguish what was the wall and what was the table and what was my friend, it was all just a part of my vision (also I was unable to understand words and had no idea where I was, who my friend was or WHAT she was, I didn't know what a human was, so I looked over her shoulder, couldn't separate objects from each other, then I couldn't separate colors, then smells tastes physical sensations emotions or anything including myself from all of this, \"I\" disappeared as is me my name my body my personality, they all blended together and went upward, it was like the room was sucked up and there was nothing left but black nothingness behind 2 energy balls made of everything that could ever be perceived, and a consciousness observing it, it wasn't really black but there was nothing there, hard to imagine nothing. Every sense and emotion and color and everything separated into 2 balls that looked white, one made of one thing and the other made of everything that contrasted what the other was made of, \"positive and negative\" consciousness observed streams come from the orbs and flow together in the middle, spreading out and back in in the center of the 2 orbs, in the center the streams the \"energies\" collided and because they were exact opposites they canceled each other out, and when the 2 separate orbs had completely merged there was nothing, no consciousness, no black or white no me or anything, it was nirvana and there was no time, no temperature, nothing that could ever be perceived and no one to not perceive anything. It is hard not to talk about it with a certain amount of mysticism, because a lot of people don't know how to describe things like this without using metaphors, because there are no words that have been invented to describe it! Streams looked more like webs, almost like smoke or a thin layer of white everything over black nothing in circles going from\n\na small point of half of everything -> spreads out in every direction and loops into a specific point -> meets other energy at specific point and match each other to become neutral <- spreads out in every direction and loops into a specific point <- a small point of half of everything\n\n\nThe next thing I remember was a few eyeballs swirling very calmly in a circle in front my vision, with nothing but black in the background, they were blue, rather realistic, then yellow cats, 3D they would stick out their tongues and open their eyes wide and spin in the circle faster when I would move around, the eyeballs would open wider and spin faster and they would leave tails of colors behind them blues pinks yellows greens reds purples, so I starting moving and kicking and throwing myself in different directions really hard and fast.\n\nI saw my friend G and she suggested something to me I don't know what it was but it had something to do with hippies or something, once again I was experiencing concepts, it was like we were making a pact, and it had happened before, it was like a spiritual pact, I don't really know, but I started kicking and moving my arms and body as fast and hard as I could, as if my life depended on it, and when I did that the cats and eyeballs would spin faster and open up and more colors would come off of them and the eyes would open super wide and something would come out of the center of them, they were completely realistic 3 dimensional and they just floated above my normal vision, the more I would kick and punch the faster and more intricate and intense they would get, I saw eyeballs and psychedelic patterns on everything, the bed the couch the floor my fingers my friends, I was under the impression I was working towards some goal, I hallucinated my friend P, who wasn't actually there, came into the room and I kept yelling his name as well as G's and 2 of my other friends, they were all a part of this thing I was doing, the air kept swirling like over a grill, and I could see these crazy green dragon type things and P would say something like *\"niiiccee\"* telling me to calm down and the patterns would get more intense and beautiful all the people there felt like my family and everything in the room held sentimental value, it was like everything was a distant memory that i was coming back to, my friends were pouring water on me, which I was unaware of for the most part, but I kept feeling something really strange it was like my hallucinations were licking my body and they would get more intense when they would pour water on me, I saw my parents and they kept trying to help me with this thing, I felt like everyone was trying to help me, and contributing as well, we kept reaching new levels of whatever it was, things kept folding out, hallucinations, feelings, people, they would get more and more intricate, I was starting to get tired from punching and kicking I had to keep going in different directions because the force pushing against me was too strong when I kept going in one direction, I felt like once I reached one thing I could never stop moving on and up, there wasn't a goal to stop at, the goal was never ending and I could never stop moving up and going further, my parents kept telling me that I had to stop and I was going to die and that there were medics that were going to come and I kept saying that I knew I could do it and that we couldn't stop, and apparently we weren't the only group of people that had done this and there were these groups that had done this, and we were one of the groups that got the farthest, it was like time didn't matter, the people that I had heard had done this before and gotten the furthest was us, and I couldn't stop because I would lose all the people and they were so important to me and every person with me had this insane special meaning to everyone with us, we were combining or something, someone called the police (not in real life)((I think?)) I could see the red and blue lights flashing and hear the sirens but I couldn't leave because I couldn't stop, my body was cut in half (because in reality I had cut my left foot really badly on a nail sticking out of a chair) and there was dark blue liquid coming up out of the floor and ceiling, there would be a flash and bruises and cuts would well up all over my body and blood would come out there was water and cat food floating in the air and I kept saying no no no I can't let you go no no no I can't let you go"

It has a heavy sinking feeling, it lacks the rush of MXE, MXM, 3-MeO-PCE or 3-MeO-PCP, rather it is just a sense of sinking into myself, sinking into whatever surface I’m on, just total sedation of my limbs to the point where they feel numb and fatigued. The sheer coldness of it almost feels sinister. Not my favorite dissociative I’ve taken, but an interesting one to explore.",

    "introduction": "I want to preface this report with a statement- In a country where drugs are illegal and enforcement of drug laws is largely predicated on race, doing drugs is NOT apolitical. As recreational drug users, we must stand unilaterally against the drug war, we must recognize how it is unevenly leveraged to systematically oppress people of color, especially black people. We must stand in solidarity with those who share with us the universal desire to alter their minds, which should be a human right, as they face repression from brutal police and laws with no basis in objective reality. Whether we like it or not we are participants in the deeply unjust drug war, as we must stand with those who are most vulnerable.\n\nJoin the ongoing protests, donate to local bail or supply funds, check your racist friends, and begin opening realistic dialogue towards opposing the drug war as another insidious arm of white supremacy and the militarized police state. Think about how unnecessary police and their violence would be with a total upheaval of American drug policy. All conversations on police abolition (or even reform I guess) should prominently feature an undoing of the American Drug War and clemency for its victims. That black lives matter should go without saying.",

I’ve noticed lately that I rarely get intense visuals from psychedelics anymore, but within this experience they are vivid and apparent. Waves of nausea bubble up occasionally but it is for the most part manageable, moreso than other lysergamides in my experience.\n\nI am tracking events now via a police scanner, an aerial live stream, and a livestream on the ground. The people have now raided a nearby Target and are expropriating goods en masse. The police on the scanner sound increasingly distressed as they are assailed by the furious crowd, raining projectiles on them. The people have now gained the initiative in this battle, the police are now defending what they can on their back foot. It is exhilarating to witness history in real time from a bunch of different perspectives. I revel in my ability to do this. My headspace is lucid and coherent, I can process thoughts clearly and rapidly without getting bogged down in loops or holes.

It sounds like every sound I hear is running off into the distance, leaving doppler tracers in their wake. Visuals chase me and trace around me as I walk, and per usual catch up with me when I stop moving, pulsing and breathing as they seep in. I encounter few other people, but I avoid them, I feel awkward and ungainly. Despite changing my surroundings my thoughts are obsessively fixated on the tension that seems to have finally broken in this country, on how unrest has begun to spring up in other cities on just the second night, on the ripples that will be felt across the nation, of how this city I’m in now and the empty streets I was walking now could very well soon be the scene of a similar uprising (and indeed, just a few days later, it was). Despite my fixations I still feel fairly lucid and coherent. There is still a stimulating buzz in my body, giving an extra little spring behind every step."

They are also notably quite apparent on my hands, with what looks like intricate rainbow tattoos of woven braided forms streaked across them, these visuals now are static but clearly defined. I catch tinges of colors in my skin that certainly aren’t actually there. The nausea has for the most part subsided and the added cannabis makes me hungrier. I heat up some food.\n\nI tune back into the stream to see an absolutely awe inspiring scene- an under construction condominium has gone up in flames, it is fully consumed by fire, a 6 story building engulfed in soaring pillars of flame, the fire is immense and furious, it is the largest building fire I have ever witnessed. The people on the street must retreat from it because the heat output is so great, the sound of it crackling and roaring overwhelms everything as it belches illuminated smoke into the sky. It must be visible for miles around, it is a towering flaming beacon calling to everyone across the country to rise up against police repression. And indeed, in the following week, uprisings, riots, protests, and mass unrest flared up in almost every single city in America, in every single state. My jaw is agape at the size and power of this fire, of how it illuminates everything, of the sheer destructive force as the building begins to collapse, of how the unrest of just a few has produced an object of such incredible force and such undeniable power. I almost want to cry tears of joy at witnessing such raw power. I am definitely sensitized right now."

    "conclusion": "Having tried it once more since this writing, 1cP-LSD now stands as one of my favorite lysergamides, second only to LSD itself. Most notable about this compound was that it was extremely visual relative to other lysergamides while remaining very lucid and coherent. There was little body load or overwhelming stimulation. The peak was intense and fairly short with a long pleasant afterglow that was still replete with delightful and ornate visuals. There wasn’t the same degree of cognitive depth or mental intensity that LSD brings about- it was certainly shallower and less introspective. This is a drug ideal for enhancing other real life experiences, such as walking around or going to concerts (whenever that’s safe again) or visiting beautiful places. Socializing was still awkward but became much more manageable during the steady functional comedown. It was at once fairly intense, yet entirely manageable. This is ideal as a beginners psychedelic for people who are just delving into the wide variety of what research chemicals have to offer.",

    "introduction": "[NOTE: This is not a typo for 3-MeO-PCP, this is a report for the semi-novel dissociative 3-Methyl-PCP, the only extant alkane substituted phenyl ring PCP analogue (for now).]\n\nI attempted 2 trials prior to this to get a sense of this compound’s character, at 10 and 12 mg intranasal. I also took a small sublingual booster dose during one of the trials. Physically the powder is pretty caustic, burning a lot when dosed intranasally and leaving a raw spot on mucous membranes when dosed sublingually, similar to 3-MeO-PCP (though without the local anesthesia that 3-MeO-PCP has). Some brief notes on its general properties at those doses were that it was lucid and functional, similar to 3-MeO-PCP or unsubstituted PCP, with a notably greater loss of motor skills. I was able to socialize without issue, and the experiences were both fairly short in duration with a pleasant drawn-out afterglow featuring an elevated mood and increased articulation, especially when combined with etizolam and cannabis in one instance. Overall at those doses, the experience was characterized by a mental stimulation with mild physical sedation, euphoria, disinhibition, light open eye visuals, and a fairly shallow headspace in terms of introspection and meditation. It was delightfully social, though this diminished as I pushed the dose up more. The short duration also lent itself to an urge to redose. The following report is the highest dose I have attempted so far, though I will say that there appear to be diminishing returns as the dose is nudged higher. It is also probably worth mentioning the steep dose/response curve, with substantial observable differences with just a 6 mg discrepancy in dose (and this is trusting my scale, so there is some wiggle room there!). Be careful with this one!",

It is a sense of suddenly being very drunk or trying to walk on a violently rocking boat. The drip begins to travel down the back of my throat, acrid and gross and burning most of the way down.\n\nI get up to get some water and my movement is extremely uncoordinated. I have a very hard time standing up straight or walking in a straight line, having to hold onto objects as I walk past. It is interesting to be so heavily incapacitated just 10 minutes into the experience. This doesn’t feel like the loss of coordination and equilibrium that comes with the full-body anesthesia of other dissociatives- rather this just feels like my limbs are not behaving how I want them to. I am still certainly aware of my body and the space it occupies."

I feel queasy, wavy, nauseous, blissful, and a bit itchy and warm at my joints. My breathing feels slower and shallower. I have limited experience with opioids but this is fairly reminiscent of them.\n\nThe experience intensifies by the second, and as time ticks down I feel that initial warmth drain away bit by bit. There is stimulation and mania running through my mind, I am thinking so much about nothing in particular, my thoughts don’t feel especially profound or useful, it’s just a machine running faster than it is supposed to. Physically I feel absolutely still, almost corpselike- as mentioned before, I am not rendered immobile by a full anesthesia. It is certainly not a hole, but a different sort of sedation, there is simply zero desire to move. Everything feels jilted out of place and all I can do is watch. There is a certain joviality and euphoria to it as it continues to build and build and as I continue to sink and sink, it is like riding a speeding boat and catching the cold spray and whipping wind with my face. Exhilarating. I really don’t know what to do with this body, it feels excessive, heavy and unnecessary. So warm yet so cold at the same time. I flick my lighter on and after letting it run for a bit, press the hot metal on my skin, curious about how numb my body is becoming. My reflexive response to the stimulus is certainly reduced. Go figure.\n\nPerhaps the other most noteworthy physical feature is how soft the numbness is-my fingertips feel spongy, or like they are sheathed in undulating clouds, squishing into my body with each keystroke."

The building rush of some dissociatives can sometimes feel like sticking my head in a stream of cold rushing water. This however, is like a lazy outflow from thermal spring, warm and gentle but with an undeniable force behind it. This builds and builds though, from a trickle to a flash flood, gobsmacking me upside the head. I am steady and still and unwavering in the face of its power, it feels like the only thing I can do. The rush of say, 3-MeO-PCP, has a biting edge, a sparkling energy. This has a similar degree of crackling flame behind it, but it is slower, softer, smoother.\n\nThere are pulsing waves of flashing visuals, subtle but apparent, like refreshment bands running the length of an old TV screen. There are spots and blotches in regular hexagonal tessellated patterns slowly and quietly blooming where I can hardly notice them. With my eyes closed I am greeted by nothing but a blue darkness.\n\nThere are clouds streaming out of my skull, towers and pillars, soft and gooey and ever expanding, I feel like I am fading more and more by the second. Such energy courses through my nerves, but it is cold and still , not a manic electrical storm, but a wad of ball lightning.\n\nUltimately I would still say this is quite similar to 3-MeO-PCP- similar in terms of overall lucidity and mental stimulation, but with a heavy streaming dissociation running through my extremities, and less of a pointed rush."

The world is spinning around me and I cannot really figure out how to place my feet. I feel shorter than I really am. I am a bit nauseous. It is hard to focus or examine the insects, which I can normally readily spot ID. They are blurry and indistinct unless I really close one eye and focus on them, and the subtle strobing of my entire field of vision only makes it more disorienting.

When I close my eyes the visuals are faint and stationary, no specific forms or images stand out beyond broad bands of dull colors. I am developing a double vision that is making it increasingly difficult to read. I find I can read better with one eye closed.\n\nThe experience kicks up in squalls, sudden raging swirling gales, blowing in swells of dissociative fog, blurring and smudging everything they drag their nebulous forms across. I keep drifting off, my eyelids keep sinking shut, my default directive seems to be to just sit here and drool on myself. My mind is awake and active, buzzing away and trying its best to process the disjointed and subdued information it is receiving- my body wants no part of such energy however.

I’m still here, on my bed, and I am acutely aware of that the entire time. Instead of a roller coaster I am quietly and gently sailing down a warm viscous river, my field of vision just some quiet color splotches. I try to meditate, to think about memories or dreams, as that often serves as an analytical jumping off point for streams of adventures into the subconscious with other dissociatives. While I would consider this a fairly intense experience, it yields nothing to me in that regard- it crosses its arms and purses its lips and keeps its secrets. Or perhaps it has none to share at all. I would certainly regard this as shallow, an experience grounded more in sensation than in cognition. Lying still on my extra soft mattress pad feels extravagant though. This is a drug for doing things, for enhancing other experiences, for socializing or dancing or just relaxing under some heavy air.

I am not entirely sure what I am even saying, the words aren’t properly registering in my memory. I am tossing them blindly into the void, hoping they are coherent. My roommates really truly look like I am viewing them on a screen, entirely divorced from their actual presence. This is kind of scary- it makes me feel like I may not realize the full weight of social consequences, that I may not properly regulate or moderate what I am saying. I am truly treading water over some deep depths. I go outside and grab a giant water bug to show them. Talking about an insect I love helps to ground me and feel more in touch, along with coming down more as time passes. After about half an hour I feel like I am socializing normally, better than normal in fact. I take them outside to show them what came to the light sheet and talk about bugs with them, this also helps to ground me. We turn the light off and pack it in, the darkness is heavy and swallowing. They go to bed."

    "conclusion": "Such an interesting and promising compound that just begs further exploration by intrepid souls! This is, as far as I’ve experienced, one that sees diminishing returns as you increase the dose. The sedation and incapacitation builds as the dose creeps up, eventually glaring out the more pleasant dissociative effects that stand at the forefront at lower doses. At 10-12 mg it feels an immaculate party drug- a euphoric rush with soft edges and a steady pace, reminiscent of unsubstituted PCP or GHB or alcohol. The dissociation of this drug is characterized by dizziness above all else, a sense of spinning and perpetual motion and steady flow. It doesn’t fully anesthetize the body or plunge the user into a hole like other dissociatives, rather it leaves one with a inhibited, off-kilter, but still fully functional and present body, with numbness and distortion rooted in the extremities and skull and seeping inwards from there. Physically, it is sedating, especially at a higher dose, a GABAergic sedation replete with heavy eyelids and slow shallow breathing. There were also odd thermal sensations, an almost feverish being hot and cold at the same time. I do not have much experience with opioids for reference but at the higher dose, sensations similar to how stronger doses of opioids are described were present. This warrants investigation from someone with more familiarity in that area! The headspace is one of stimulation and very slight mania at lower doses. As the dose increases, this is replaced with a dumbfounded neutrality, like just being stunned and unable to properly process thoughts or stimuli. Visual effects are slight, and mostly only with eyes open. With eyes closed, any visuals were barely discernible at any dose. \n\nIt is not the most introspective and doesn’t seem to lend itself much to therapeutic use. It is however, delightfully hedonistic and euphoric (especially at lower doses) and would be an excellent party drug. What I found it most similar to in fact was alcohol, just being a little past buzzed at 10 mg (or perhaps like I said before, GHB, but a bit stimmier). These returns deplete as the dose increases however, and it quickly turns into a disorienting and less rewarding experience that simply incapacitates the user. The short duration is also noteworthy, though there is a drawn out afterglow, it is subtle and not the typical stimulation that lasts after a dissociative and keeps a user awake in the dark. This does however, lend itself to a desire to redose, which could be problematic with the compounding effects as dosage increases. As mentioned before, this is one for fans of PCP, Alcohol, Poppers, or GHB. This is a fun and worthwhile compound, so long as you aren’t expecting too much depth from it! ",

Within each little screen of vision, the image mirrors and splits and fractalizes further. It feels like my field of vision is a dome on all sides of me, that I am seeing everywhere at once in all these little windows.

The attention that went into the cinematography, the writing, the costumes, the editing, the soundtrack, it all becomes apparent. It is truly a very heavily enhanced experience and I would highly recommend people do it with their favorite films.\n\nThe first 20 minutes of the film consists of a great deal of super loud and brutal revving noises. I begin to get worried about falling into a bad trip, as the movie gets pretty violent right off the bat. The first road battle is extremely intense, no other word for it. I project myself onto the characters and it becomes frightening honestly, to imagine being in their position. Amongst explosions, shrapnel, flying metal, fire, heavy machines and wheels-I feel like I am on the verge of being brutally mangled just watching. I feel like I can feel the heat and shockwaves of the fires and explosions. This is wild, visuals aren’t too apparent now because I’m so focused on the stimulation from the movie. I still feel sweaty and uncomfortable. It feels like I am flying around the screen when there are wide angle and establishing shots."

I have experienced it several other times however and can say the draw the following conclusions: DPT is a very intense psychedelic that hits hard and fast if taken the most efficient way-insufflation. It is one of the most uncomfortable drugs to insufflate, due to the chalkiness and god-awful flavor of the powder. It fluffs up and sticks to the insides of the sinuses, forming clumps and clinging to everything. It also stings a good bit. I always would have a bloody nose the next day. After that, the trip comes on incredibly hard and fast with an uneasy combination of nausea and intense sweating. It crashes over to deliver a consistently profound experience that feels challenging in a stimulating and healthy manner.\n\nThe visuals are vivid and alien, geometric and harmonious in a way that does not seem abstract or fully organic. They are colorful and spectacular. The headspace is not lucid relative to the world around me, but lucid within its own paradigm, allowing for coherent and consistent navigation of profoundly altered and alien thoughts. It rages for a bit and wears off relatively quickly. It is not for the faint of heart, but it’s absolutely worth it for those willing to put up with the intensity and deep discomfort it may instill.",

        "description": "My friend goes inside. I suddenly find myself alone in public, tripping extremely hard. I sit down on a bench and try not to attract attention to myself, but everyone walking by seems to be staring at me. This makes me very nervous, so I try to look as unassuming as possible. The sidewalk extends away from me into infinity. Every straight line is blurring and rippling. The trees are mirroring themselves and emitting rainbows. Every time I catch a snippet of someone's conversation as they walk by, I focus intensely on what words I can catch. Everything feels so trivial, every little interaction with people and every little action we perform.\n\nMy mind is suddenly taken by a grand cynical specter. It distorts my thoughts into a cold, calculating, and critical analysis of the interactions of others- they all seem so superficial and trivial. I develop the idea that people interact not to interact with others but as a sort of game where people try to validate themselves by bouncing ideas, concepts, and words off each other in the hopes that they will gain approval. I begin to see social interaction as a bartering of validation. These racing, cynical, critical thoughts rage unabated."

The walk back is just as scary as sitting on the bench was, and I try to pay attention to my numb body to make sure I'm not physically moving in a way that may draw negative attention to me. The cynicism is not just outward projections, it’s heavily internalized too. As much as I can criticize others, it feels wrong to do so without harshly berating myself."

The torrent of thought and meditation and introspection is indescribable and impossible to put into words. The flowery fractals on my ceiling dance to the music as my racing thoughts calm down and the triviality of the world gives way to great beauty. Everything is wonderful and beautiful, everything is done with great intention, and although it may seem trivial, it is all connected and builds to something grand. I’m not sure what mental gymnastics I leapt through to experience a complete reversal of my mindset. Esoteric and evasive patterns crept through my mind, rewiring and restructuring everything in ways that were beyond my grasp."

When it was shipped the vendor warned that in warmer months it would sometimes arrive to the customer in entirely liquid form. I break off and weigh out 12 mg of the mass and drop it into a freebase pipe (a glass tube stuffed with copper scrubber, or a “crack pipe” if you will). I use gentle heat to melt it into the scrubber a bit, it melts quickly without much resistance. I have stuffed most of the length of the tube with scrubber to ensure it remains trapped within.\n\nI apply gentle heat to the end, not touching the pipe directly with the flame. I am immediately greeted by a mouthful of acrid tryptamine smoke, reminiscent of naphthalene (moth balls) but sweeter. I reflexively cough the first hit out. The next two I am able to hold in for about 10 seconds."

This is immediately fairly intense. Visuals present now as rippling like heat waves, radiating off of concentric pulses from the edges of my visual field, each pulse making the world appear more clear as it drags across my pupils, a foreign impossible clarity.\n\nMy body is wracked with a twisting stimulation and sense of discomfort. My eyes begin to water as my heart races and I feel short of breath. There are tendrils of energy that are trying to shoot out of me but they have become twisted and tangled and distorted in my limbs, and they buzz angrily within my muscles as they become more and more stopped up. I wish I could just release them but I don’t know how.\n\nWaves of nausea begin to pass through me now as I hit the pipe more and more. The sense of dissociation and tight stimulation builds and builds. Now when I close my eyes I am greeted by an electric blue spot, levitating above an indistinct “floor” of swirling forms that appear to be shrouded in fog, extending infinitely into blackness in all directions. They are dull and colorless. Upon opening my eyes the spot remains, like an afterimage after staring at a bright light. I take one hit of cannabis from a bowl now to try and dull the nausea a bit.\n"

The nausea builds and builds too as time passes, and there are several points where I feel like I might throw up, but it doesn’t come. The intensity is bearing down on me like a freight train built from glowing streamers of razor clear wind. Closed eyed visuals are like strings and tendrils of neon lights, intertwining and racing through the void, tangling up on each other. Their presence and energy makes my head throb.

There are flashes of small spots of various colors at the corners of my vision, bold and striking.

The closed eyed visuals are dim, indistinct, gloomy, and moody. Still the same swirling forms, illuminated by a dim light, like trying to find my way in the fog with just the light of my phone screen. I feel on edge, cynical but in a sly and sardonic way. I feel like this drug has slapped me in the face. I want to throw up. I feel poisoned but happy about it.

Yet is doesn’t exist at all in my body or hormones, so the feeling ultimately passes without result, still fairly neutral. It was just another thing to think about, though it was unique in that sex is not something I ever really think about while tripping.\n\nThe physical discomfort has mostly subsided by now, as has the crackling, arcing intensity of the trip. I have a sense of being in the right place at the right time. The sun is shining, it’s warm outside, I am happy to be here. There is a euphoria in this tranquility, not the radiating sunbathed optimism that I experienced on the 4-HO analogue of this chemical, but a more peaceful and matter-of-fact sense of wellbeing.

    "conclusion": "5-MeO-Tryptamines are truly unique. Devoid of visuals but undeniably intense in every other way.  Distinctly psychedelic in their cognitive effects, but in a manner that is truly unlike any other class of psychedelic. 5-MeO-MALT was no exception. The experience of the vaporized route of administration was short and fast as vaporized tryptamines usually are. The trip was wracked with stimulation throughout, tense and impactful. The initial stages were like being blasted headlong through a rippling membrane into a clearer reality, fast enough to drive tears from my eyes. It was like having my brain wrung out; like being slapped with psychedelia. Physical side effects were concerning enough for me not to push the dose higher, but I was certainly interested to see how much further it could go. Slight visuals presented as indistinct flashes of color, devoid of pattern or reason. The blistering intensity of it eventually gave way to a satisfying comfort, then to a gentle focused stimulation. Overall, I wouldn’t call it an enjoyable experience, but a novelty worth experiencing for an explorer who seeks that. I have no particular desire to repeat this anytime soon, but I would be interested in seeing how other routes of administration manifest, and in trying some of the other 5-MeO Tryptamines out there to see how they all compare.

It feels like the entirety of my existence has been sequestered and pinched off from the rest of reality, placed in its own neat little snow globe, and that snow globe is now being gently swirled, rocked, shaken back and forth.\n\nEverything feels fast, like my movements are faster, my thoughts faster, the entirety of my being is a runaway train on a fast path to a canyon filled with pillows. I feel like I am made of clay, drooping and being molded and pinched by gravity, and being subject to a hot wet wind. It is like the wind that blows through a jungle, carrying the breaths of a million lives on it, all of these breaths colliding with my body like raindrops. I feel weird little blips of pressure on random parts of my body.\n\nI decide to try and focus on the visuals. The closed eyed visuals are compartmentalized and blocky, like lego or stained glass or low-res pixel art. Even with my eyes open this effect continues, lines begin to draw themselves and cross my field of vision. They split it into cells, and each cell breaks off to dance in its own individual essence, some are hot, some are cold, they spin and tilt and entwine and interlock. I begin to physically feel this visual essence of things being reduced to grains and particles- the feeling of gravel flowing past me and around me like a river, like they are the molecules of a liquid.\n\nI feel so heavy, I am couchlocked and have no desire to move. I am being massaged by a river of gravel, the world around me is crumbling into blocks and bricks that join this burgeoning stream, it’s so warm and it feels so great. Something about this strikes at my emotions. I want to cry, not about anything in particular, I just want to feel the emotional release.\n\nVisuals and headspace are still building more and more. I do not know or care when I am peaking. The motion of all these blocks feels like the interlocking moving parts of some intricate machine, as though existence has been pared down and reduced to pixels, the incredibly complicated mechanisms of the world turned into these simple representations. I close my eyes and am presented with a great blue and green landscape that looks painted- it is heavy with broad brush strokes that captured a reduced essence of what must be a more intricate scene.\nI suddenly feel like I am floating an inch off of the ground. This is a peculiar feeling. I am tearing up, and it feels great. Despite the fact that I am floating, I feel so heavy, as if my weight has granted me my own gravity that keeps the world in orbit an inch away from me. I feel like I am buried and constrained in a tomb of blocks that roughly surrounds my shape. It’s pretty neat I guess."

The couchlock, the abstract yet simplistic visuals of the CEV’s, the deeply emotional and introspective headspace, this is probably the most meditative drug I’ve taken. I am feeling some amnesia and have difficulty remembering very recent actions, but with some focus I can maintain a coherent line of thought.

I am certainly feeling a euphoric glow from this drug, but why? Why does it feel good? This leaves me eventually with the question- Why do I like what I like? I pose the question to several people and it catches most of the off guard. What is the pure essence of happiness for me? I do a lot of things under the guise of them bringing me happiness, immediate or long term, but what exactly is that happiness? Perhaps if I burrow down into the essence of it, I can perhaps find some way around all the tedium of everyday life and learn to harness good feelings in a pure and productive way.\n\n\nThis brings me to think a great deal about my future- what am I pursuing? What is my overall goal in everything? Indeed everything I do builds towards some overall goal, whether it be a happy existence or building a better world for others. But what is the pure essence of a happy existence? A better world? What are the basics of these I should pursue? I realize that it feels like I am blindly pursuing and bowing to some essence that I am convinced is instinctually programmed into me. But perhaps I can dissect what I regard as instinct and discover new ways to alter my behaviors, habits, thought processes, and reactions to stimuli. But that’s enough thinking for now, I feel warm, like I am sitting by a campfire surrounded by a beautiful forest. The glow is accentuated by fireflies and the comfort of knowing that I am where I want to be in that moment.\n\n\nMy hands are heavy and I'm feeling a strong sense of empathy. I want to hug my friends, I want to help them dissect their thoughts to feel more satisfied and happy with the lives they lead, because so many of my friends are so depressed and dissatisfied all the time."

        "description": "I’m getting restless cooped up in this house. I throw on some clothes, throw some supplies into a bag, and embark on an adventure. I decide I will walk to the Philadelphia art museum. The walk is weird. I am dissed as hell still. People feel alien, like cardboard cutouts, but they are strangers on a dark night. The world seems to give way before me, rising out of the fog that obscures it. It is all pieces that are coming to form and interlock before me, for the pleasure of my interaction. I reach the art museum and realize that I walked that entire distance (~3 miles) without stopping once. My body is frail and I’m not physically capable of much. There are people who can run that distance without breaking a sweat, but me, I am so weak. The exhaustion catches up with me when I reach my destination. I smoke a lot of weed by the river and look at the glow of the city. Everything just feels so right. I decided on what would make me feel good, and I went out and did it, and now I am here, feeling good, doing things. I close my eyes and sink into that same world of swirling blocks and forms. This feels so psychedelic, this entire experience has felt more psychedelic than dissociatives. It has fostered wonderful and comfortable thinking and granted me shining and colorful insight into my mind.\n\nI go to the museum and collect insects near the great spotlights. I listen to music and lie in the grass and gaze at the city, imagining all the lives there, imagining what it is that makes all of those individual people happy. Visually, my vision is still warping and pulsing, and everything has a greenish tinge. It makes the whole night feel dreamy and magical. There are a lot of people there but they pay me no heed. I am coordinated and can walk fine, I was a bit wobbly on the way over but I do not outwardly appear to be on drugs now. My limbs feel like they are glowing and glistening. I decide to go home, but I am feeling pretty exhausted. They are setting up for some huge event in front of the museum, and I have to skirt it as I feel like I would look suspicious as hell wandering through (There were several workmen and security people at work there). It’s a twinge of panic and paranoia, but it fades to the sense of adventure that comes from just walking around at this hour of night, and the wonderful feeling of having the total freedom to do this whenever I want. When I began this trip, I had no intention of leaving the house, but then I decided I wanted to, and I did, and now I am here. How cool is that? Subways do not run this late, so I must catch a bus. By sheer luck I run into the bus just as it passes the street I am walking on. I hop on, count my blessings, and enjoy a comfortable ride home."

    "conclusion": "Diphenidine is gazed upon with an eye of suspicion and fear in much of the drug community, or at the very best is seen as a more lacking version of its cousin, Ephenidine. A poor man’s ephenidine. Many people note its fiendish nature, in that it makes people fiend for it like addicts. Others note the potentially carcinogenic effects of smoking it. Most however, note the hardcore amnesia that can lead to serious blackouts and serious behavioral issues with that. Few have nice things to say. I supposed I had an atypical experience. This is perhaps my favorite dissociative I have ever taken. Very similar to 3-MeO-PCE. It is euphoric, incredibly profound and insightful, and tears at the deepest core of my emotions. It grants me a beautiful experience, and instills a sort of mania that always puts me to action, whether it be going for a long walk at 2 AM or contacting my ex for the first time in 9 months (happened last time I did it). I can certainly see how that can be dangerous, and I am blessed that my memory remains intact, as that manic activity combined with amnesia is a recipe for disaster. The body feel is an incredibly pleasant buzzing, a simultaneous heaviness and weightlessness, warm chills and a numbness that feels like a warm bath. Perhaps I am playing with fire, but it’s a beautiful numbing fire that drives the mind to colorful valleys of gemstones.",

The cognitive and mental effects are almost non-existent, rather it is a sensation of confusion and irritation driven by the physical effects. Nothing is any more interesting or stimulating than normal, as psychedelics will often do. Rather every bit of input becomes tedious and tiresome. I don’t want to perceive anything. My thoughts are for the most part rumination on the fact that it feels like I have poisoned myself. Sensory effects are also near non-existent. Slight and subtle visuals came about on the tail end of the experience but they were absolutely nothing interesting or worthwhile. The duration was extremely short too, which is normally quite disappointing for any drug, but with this substance I was glad the experience passed quickly. I do not see any reason to experiment further with this.",

I notice the visual effects used in the show strongly resemble the experience of being on dissociatives, especially DXM. I begin to think about that state and it almost feels like I’m replicating it just by thinking about it. Visuals are flashing in red and green, they are boldest when I blink really fast. CEV’s seem like pretty mild swirling and patterning, and OEV’s are faint patterns on the walls, reminiscent of 2C-B. Auditory effects come in the sense of losing all depth, with far away things sounding close by, with some echoing and reverb. Mentally, I am very lucid, it feels like being very stoned, I am pretty spacey and dazed and my mind wanders a lot. However it feels “clearer” and “sharper”, like the fogginess of being stoned is gone. "

I was not able to find much about it on the internet save for a few scattered reports. I opted for smoking it, as insufflation was reported as painful and I’m not keen on plugging.\nIn these experiments I smoked the HCl salt. I’m unaware of the heat of vaporization or the heat of pyrolysis for this salt or for the freebase chemical. However, the salt is certainly active to some degree when smoked. I am not sure how this might affect dosage either. The powder was smoked from a conventional glass pipe, sandwiched between layers of either Cannabis or Mugwort. Combustion was achieved with gentle controlled heating, ‘teasing’ with the flame similar to how DMT is smoked.\nThese were several trials performed across a period of 8 months. I am not including them in chronological order, but rather in the order of which reports I think are the most relevant or useful.",

It’s not the classical dissociative feeling of numbness and lack of coordination, rather a feeling of my body sinking into a warm bath and dissolving. There is also this sinking feeling focused on my head, a familiar dissociating sensation. A feeling like I can feel the weight of my brain inside my skull, that my meninges are the fabric of reality and my mind is sinking like a gravity well into its depths, and the rest of my being, my sense of body, my sense of self, is slowly sinking down into it, flashing, pulsing, rippling.\n\nIt has a flatness to it that reminds me of its cousin 5-MeO-DALT… For reference, that’s a feeling of my entire field of vision becoming a single flat image with no spatial distinction between objects or anything really, I am gazing upon one singular image. The taste in my mouth is now reminiscent of the way a clothing store smells."

OEVs are there, but evade description. Like they are entirely noticeable, but don’t manifest in any familiar way. It’s not patterns, or warping, or breathing, or swirling, or shifts in color, no pulsing or bulging or rippling, things just look different.

Yet there is a physical restlessness I cannot shake, it twitches deep in my bones and in my veins, indeed my heart rate has felt artificially quickened during this experience despite my otherwise calm.

It’s like throwing a great warm psychedelic blanket over your mind, and having it dissolve over the course of an hour. It’s quite pleasant with a bit of restlessness deep in the body. If only it lasted longer, if only it was easier to consume. It’s both intense and lacking any sort of intensity, it’s a very unique and novel substance and experience, although many probably wouldn’t consider the effects ‘worthwhile’ in comparison to other psychedelics. DALT by itself is honestly not too interesting, it’s when combined with other drugs that it really shines.",

Tiny specks surf along surfaces, limited to the proximity of their real location. They bend and twist and twitch before taking the form of scorpions and spiders and vague microscopic critters. They walk around with no apparent aim, losing their volatile legs with every step, but new ones sprout in the same moment. One faces another and I'm quite entertained to watch their little standoff. Despite having a realistic appearance, they dance in a cartoonish weightless rubbery motion, the velocity of which starts slow but quickly picks up speed until the end, when it decelerates smoothly. It's no surprise that the starting motion of physical, real, objects must accelerate and decelerate slowly as inertia is overcome, but these hallucinations exaggerate this aspect of reality to the point of being unnaturally silly.\n\nSome of the forms and patterns arising and subsiding in this effervescent soup of static strike me as profoundly aesthetic and intimate, alike innately understood imagery, that represents specific primary emotions and concepts that make up the building blocks of my thinking."

The tactile sensation on my face vastly overpowers the one that should be felt too on the palm of my hand. When body parts press against each other, we recognize both of them as our own because there's a balance of tactility where they meet. My hand felt alien, in the sense it feels like the hand of someone else. I take the hand off and open my eyes to investigate to find myself dissociated from that hand. It gained a surprising floatiness, as if it was full of light gas. Dissociative effects such as these would continue to appear, throughout the trip, lasting no more than a minute. Distortions of proprioperception feel eerily similar to that of dextromethorphan."

Some even fool me into thinking my cat had entered my room, because the noise was exactly the same as the hushed sound my cat's nails make on contact to the hard wood floor.\n\nStaring for a few seconds where my desk meets the wall I see a vibrant eletric pink cloud bubbling with smaller dark clouds behind a document binder, which I believed was actually there until illusion ended. The lack of static and bright colors felt of psychedelic nature.\n\nI lay in bed on my back with a pillow over my eyes, stiff and trembling from the drug, and put on one of my favorite albums to listen to while zonked out: Ceres & Calypso in the Deep Time. Seconds later, I can see the room, dimly and in monochrome, seemingly through the pillow (so much that I checked twice if it was badly positioned), from the same perspective I'd see it laying down. Attempting to shift my gaze down from the ceiling to inspect this miniature alternate reality seemingly within my pillow would make the vision slip away. I got better at holding the illusion, with a few attempts. Furniture would sometimes switch places, for example, the dark rectangle that is my wardrobe door would become a tall shelf or vice versa. Decorative items and memorabilia on shelves, regardless of being there in reality or not, were a blur that I can only describe as rapidly rearranging cubist[1] version of themselves, an amalgam of overlapping viewpoints of themselves, of related objects and aesthetics.\n\n[1] More specifically: https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/analytical-cubism"

I hear the jingle of a key ring, then a key turning the lock, then once all the pins of the lock have been freed the door swings open with that characteristic, the familiar sound I've heard hundreds of times throughout daily life. I hear muffled steps and, as usual, my cat throttling to the door to greet the visitor. This one fooled me because of how realistic and perfectly timed in sequence the sounds were. Only when I went looking for someone in other parts of the home, did I start to doubt that occurrence.\n\nWhat I find the most interesting about this hallucination is that I could've not heard my cat run to the door, if it wasn't a hallucination. The door is too far away from my room for me to be able to hear that. The first sounds were properly adjusted by the hallucination to fit into the current space I was in, by making the sounds muffled and convincingly distorted by the walls they have to bounce off before reaching me, but the sounds of the cat running were played as if I was close. There seems to be a break of continuity the moment I hear the cat, and that is perhaps why this hallucination didn't progress further.\n\nI keep failing to enter a focused meditative state on my breath for long, because I keep being distracted by sudden flashes of fuzzy psychedelic geometry, encompassing all of my vision."

I had been wide-awake in bed for a handful of hours. I give up in the clearly futile effort of falling asleep, and try to pivot the residual stimulation towards tasks I had due and cleaning/housework.\n\nDespite me being a bit loopy from not having slept after a deliriant trip, the residual stimulation carried on my day as normal, well past 24 hours since the initial administration.\n\nI managed to sleep the next day (34 hours and 50 minutes since the initial administration of benzydamine), which I think marks the definitive end of the drug's effects, hence, the end of this trip report, too."

    ],
    "conclusion": "This first benzydamine trip had been surprisingly lucid, as it didn't impair me, mentally and physically, as profoundly as classical deliriants have before, for an equivalent hallucinosis. Distortions of reality touched on sinister themes, but I never got immersed in their narratives (apart from a couple of brief auditory hallucinations), hence, they held little power over my reality. I had this unwavering curiosity of what amusing situation or strange sensation would face me next, until the hallucinations ceased being novel and I became disinterested.\n\nMixing it with a dissociative should be interesting. Deliriants and dissociatives generally synergize well, covering up the negative effects of each other, although benzydamine is an atypical deliriant (is it the only one? what others exist that we don't know are anticholinergics?). Cardiac effects might be a concern.\n\nIt wasn't without adverse effects, although:\n* Hand finger tremors\n* Increased heartbeat and frequent heart palpitations, which I think could be dangerous if this effect ramps up with dose\n* Frequent urination and subsequent dehydration. I kept drinking lots of water, but that did not completely alleviate thirst and cotton mouth (although it isn't nearly as bad as anticholinergic deliriants). It seemed to not have been absorbed or made use of by my body, as I'd urinate a concerning large volume of clear urine about one hour later after drinking a cup of water.\n* Decrease of motor coordination (most noticeable when trying to type)\n* Loose short term memory, which would derail my train of thought by making me forget what I was thinking seconds ago.\n* Unwavering insomnia. THE aspect that keeps me from doing this again so soon, I imagine it gets especially torturous after larger doses and more unpleasant trips than mine. If you thought the trip itself made you feel paranoid, wait until you haven't slept 24 hours after the fact.\n\nOverall, an interesting experience that I'm excited to explore further in the future. Also, benzydamine trip reports typically mention the substance's unique tracers, I'm disappointed I didn't get any.",

Each of their curls looked like a tiny humanoid figure, and when I got closer I saw the figure had figures of itself on each of it's fingers, and so on. Recursively no matter how close up I got to look. I switched to looking at my arms and saw the figure repeated in the form of a texture all over my skin, with the details of teeth and flesh and gory figures morphing and forming on my skin.

Critiquing how poor my sleep was or how I didn't stick to my diet and workouts as much as I'd like, almost angry over how easily I let myself brush things off or make excuses to continue this awful cycle of unproductive working and terrible sleep habits, upset that I let myself get into this \"just another day\" mentality.

I'd definitely like to experience something similar in the future, I think the setting was an amazing choice, though sort of disappointed the first tab didn't do anything while I was canoeing. The forest and lake were absolutely beautiful to look at, and so was the campfire. I didn't do nearly as much introspection or reflection that I'd normally do on tryptamines, which was almost refreshing in a way that I could just enjoy my evening and finish off a great week at my cottage.

As of writing this report, two days later, I have not tried 2-FMA again as I haven't felt the need to, my mood and motivation have both been elevated, whether as a result of the initial experiment, I'm not sure.

The entire time I had to try to make myself comfortable, changing up the pillows nor music didn't help.\n\nI hope to revisit this substance in the future through a different ROA, along with EPT, which someone requested me to compare against.\nI expect EPT to be similar but less potent, so I don't think I'll even bother with trying it orally first.",

My socks felt weird, so I took them off. At this point in time I felt hot and almost sweaty, but fairly quickly I began to feel cold and craved the warmth, and as such I wrapped myself up in a blanket cocoon. I feel pressure on my teeth, and on my eardrums. My back is in pain, as well as a muscle I pulled earlier in the week hurting a lot more suddenly. It seems as if all the minor uncomfortable things I normally deal with and ignore are amplified 100x, and are the main focus point of anything for me now. I have tinnitus that is growing increasingly loud and is becoming harder to ignore, so I scramble to put on any sort of music to help with it. Everything is blurring, with tracers trailing behind as I look around the room, with everything stretching and twisting like I had taken some sort of Alice in Wonderlandesque cake. Everything is so tense and uncomfortable.\n\nMy vision itself is flickering rapidly, and everything is covered in fractals, as well as incredibly intricate geometric patterns. The flickering and changing of patterns slows quite a lot once the music comes on, almost matching the tune of the song. I skipped through a few different genres while trying to find something comfortable, and whatever I listened to strongly correlated with the visuals. I was barely able to make out what I was reading on my screen, and as a result, was relying on randomly skipping through spotify. Eventually I found something that felt more comfortable, and landed on my playlist that is fittingly titled \"i want these songs played at my funeral\", which is mostly made up of vaporwave and synthwave.\n\nAt some point I closed my eyes, and experienced incredibly comprehensive and intricate Level 5 internal hallucinations. I had heard them described to me before, as well as read the article that we have on the SEI, but I had always felt that the replications made depicting them were a form of artistic interpretation, and I would have never known I was so wrong. I am traversing down a hallway with walls made up of lines of a thousand things, each stripe being a pattern of a group of a type of things. Various arcane symbols, social media icons, pyramids made up the masses of things, as well as catboys at some point. I felt like I had stepped into some elaborate StingrayZ gif. I felt a lot more comfortable by this point, as I was disconnected from my physical senses and was no longer painfully uncomfortable. "

I now sit here, exhausted and worn out, as if I am a wrung-out rag.\n\nI'd exercise more caution, and start a lot lower, when revisiting this substance, should I ever plan to. I feel that I am satisfied in my venturing out to base tryptamines, and I've learned that things can get more intense than I ever imagined. I'm glad that the experience itself was fairly short-lived, without lasting effects.",

No resemblance to the more ubiquitous ‘Noids.\n\nFaint facial numbness emerges. Pair that with a mild, but fairly long-lasting temple-pounding and head squeeze. Reminds me of taking a nicotine-rich drag after a long break from smoking. No euphoria within a 50 mile radius. I feel affected, but not in a way I can even functionally describe, as disappointing as that sounds.\n\nTherapeutic doses are not recreational. My thoughts seem very collected, and the “cognitive swarm” that flairs up daily, has been tranquilized. This might be a very introverted Gabapentinoid – that isn’t to say that it’s doing nothing.

This stuff is permeable, much more so than muscimol evidently (due to the presence of the piperidine ring, as per my speculation). A light stiffness is clinging to various parts of my body, starting from the neck and trickling down. My notes on robotripping refer to this as \"DXM neck\", just one of a few curious parallels between the physicality of DXM and Gaboxadol. Nearing the peak (30 min), even walking is quite DXM-like. Not quite a stroll through thick mud, but definitely not a fluid gait. "

The visual periphery is infiltrated by flickering lights, tracers, but OEV's aren't noteworthy otherwise. The continuity of perceived time progression and spatial awareness is disrupted, crumbling into the jagged movement of a flea (more on this in my previous post). A single fixated-upon frame at any given moment appears to be part of a snapshot of spacetime already experienced. Immediately recent past is mistaken for the immediate future, which is mistaken for the present. Things appear to appear several steps ahead, in time.\n\nOnce the stimuli of the outside world are behind the veils of closed eyelids, the truly ineffable mind-fuckery blooms. A rapidly changing slideshow of random scenes contoured by yellow neon lines, each scene springing into the next with the lines unbroken. In between the scenes, or perhaps as a constant transparent overlay, hangs the Halo: a quivering circular rainbow stretching across the visual field, and an uncannily consistent aspect of Gaboxadol's CEV gamut.\n\nThe rings of the Halo pulsate independently in a disorganized, white-noise fashion. At doses lower than 45 mg, only a faint rigmarole of rainbow lines can be seen against the backdrop of closed eyelids, without a discernible structure. Neither the slideshow nor the aggressive kaleidoscope fade, as I inadvertently slip out of consciousness. "

I feel propelled forward — inside a tunnel, or some other kind of narrow space — amidst oncoming torrents of floating debris. This debris is, in fact, the collection of thoughts that form in the backdrop of this immensely aggressive propulsion. I can not only formulate a thought — I can *see* it dart past my subjective awareness. If a thought becomes salient, it is momentarily \"swatted out of the way\" by whatever is carrying me forward. Not only is my train of thought, therefore, completely hijacked — the train is replaced by an interstellar vessel carrying me through the asteroidal mist of my own thoughts. All of this is not even strictly metaphorical, and I am not just visualizing. I am *seeing* this moving caricature of my hijacked thought process, the bizarre tunnel flight that culminates in an easily predictable state. "
