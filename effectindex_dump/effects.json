While some entities do not seem to be aware of a person's presence, others are often precognizant of a person's appearance into their realm and usually choose to interact with them in various ways. For example, they will often display behaviours such as showing a person around the realm that they inhabit, presenting them with objects, holding spontaneous celebrations of their arrival, engaging them in conversation, merging into and out of the person's body or consciousness, and attempting to impart knowledge of various kinds.[/p]\n\n[toc /]\n\n[p]Entities can take any form, but certain archetypes are present and commonly include:[/p]\n\n[p][i]Humans[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"4\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"3\" /] [i]shadow people, bodiless super intelligent humanoids, aliens[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"5\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"4\" /] [i]elves[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"6\" /] [i]animals[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"7\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"5\" /] [i]giant spheres, insectoids[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"8\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"6\" /] [i]beings of light, anthropomorphic beings[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"9\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"7\" /] [i]plants[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"10\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"8\" /] [i]conscious inanimate objects, fictional characters, cartoons, robotic machines, gods[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"11\" /] [i]demigods, goddesses, bio-mechanical intelligences, hooded figures, demons, indescribable monstrosities, spirits[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"12\" /] [i]angels[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"13\" /] [i]shamans, ghosts, souls, ancestors, fantastical or mythological beasts, glitch creatures, and more[/i].[/p]\n\n[p]The appearance, personality, and behaviour of an autonomous entity often correlates with the psychological state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person with a positive mindset will more commonly experience loving, kind, and healing entities. In contrast, a person with a negative mindset may experience hateful, sinister, and mocking entities.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of their overall visibility and clarity, this effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 3 different levels of intensity described below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Vaguely defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, autonomous entities generally consist of poorly defined outlines and silhoettes that are barely distinguishable from the background behind them. However, this is still often accompanied by a distinct feeling of \"[int-link to=\"/effects/sensed-presence\"]sensed presence[/int-link]\".[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#8f8e8d\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, autonomous entities become entirely visible within one’s visual field and distinguishable from their background, but are not fully defined in their appearance. This means that, although clearly visible, they do not look completely detailed and are often blurry or semi-translucent. At this point, it also becomes more common to feel a sense of general intent and personality attributed to the entity.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the autonomous entities become distinct enough in their detail and vividness to extend beyond transparent, colourless, or blurry manifestations. They are now capable of a completely convincing and photorealistic appearance and their behaviour also becomes far more lifelike.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]The experience of seeing autonomous entities is also often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link],[ref to=\"5\" no=\"2\" /] [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link]. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/visual\"]psychedelics[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociatives[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants\"]deliriants[/int-link]. However, it can also occur under the influence of stimulant psychosis, with extreme sleep deprivation, or during dreams.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2 id=\"communication-styles\"]Communication Styles[/h2]\n[p]Autonomous entities can communicate with a person via a combination of spoken word, “telepathy”, conceptual thoughts, choreographed movements, mathematics, and geometry-based visual linguistics that generally consist of morphing coloured structures of different textures that are innately understandable as representations of specific concepts. They will often convey insights regarding overcoming personal issues within a person’s life and will occasionally help clarify philosophical or spiritual ideas. However, more often than not, entities are very likely to speak in a cryptic or nonsensical manner that seems to have no clear meaning behind it.[/p]\n\n[p]It is important to note that autonomous entities can never convey novel information to the person experiencing them. For example, they cannot provide insights about the external world that a person did not already know on some level. Instead, they can only provide alternative perspectives and help build upon existing ideas. This is presumably because autonomous entities do not have access to any knowledge not already contained within one's conscious or subconscious memories.[/p]\n\n[p]When communicated with through spoken word, the level of coherency in which these entities can communicate with is highly variable but can be broken down into five distinct levels. These are described and listed below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Silence\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, the effect can be described as a complete unresponsiveness from the entity and a lack of speech despite their presence within the hallucination.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses and noises that almost sound like words but do not contain any real content or meaning beyond a vague sense of emotional intent.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as audible linguistic conversational responses and noises that contain fully defined and understandable words, but often lack grammatical structure or an overall sense of general coherency.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain fully defined and understandable words with a partially defined grammatical structure and general coherency. It conveys its point on a level that is frequently coherent, but may not always be fully understandable and will sometimes descend into broken grammar or even gibberish.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the highest level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain understandable words and fully defined grammatical sentence structures. It has an overall sense of general coherency, which conveys its point in a level of detail that is genuinely on par with that of a person’s own intellect.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2 id=\"personality-types\"]Personality Types[/h2]\n[p]Autonomous entities will often embody at least one of a few approximate personality types. Although there is considerable overlap between them, these personality types can typically be identified primarily through their behaviour, their appearance, and an innate sense of their character that is often felt during the interaction.[/p] \n\n[p]The individual types are broken down and described within the four separate categories listed below:[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-characters\"]Representations of characters[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any hallucinatory character that the brain has either spontaneously generated during the trip or was already aware of at a prior time. These entities can include newly hallucinated characters of any sort, people that the person has met in real life, people that the person is aware of as existing in the real world, or characters from fictional media. These entities will usually adopt an appropriate personality and set of mannerisms to fit the chosen concept with an impressive degree of detail. An example of this might be meeting an insectoid mantis like creature that is playing the role of a shamanic teacher and acting accordingly. Another might include meeting the hallucination of a deceased loved one or a currently living family friend.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-ideas-and-concepts\"]Representations of ideas and concepts[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any known concept or idea. These specific concepts could include personified representations of abstract ideas, events, and emotions. An example of this might be meeting a mocking jester that feels and acts as if it represents one's own insecurities. Another might include meeting a group of hooded figures that feel as if they represent the very concept of organized religion itself.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-the-subconscious\"]Representations of the subconscious[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as an entity that may take any visible form, but is also subjectively perceived to be an autonomous controller behind the continuous generation of the details of the person’s current hallucinations. They may also be felt to simultaneously control or manage one’s current perspective, personality, and internally stored model of reality. When interacted with, this category of entity can often possess abilities that allow them to directly alter and manipulate one’s current experiences. They commonly want to teach or guide the person and will operate under the assumption that they know what is best for them. However, although a relatively common experience, it still cannot be known whether this type of autonomous entity is genuinely a representation of the \"subconscious\" or is merely an approximation that behaves in a convincing manner.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-the-self\"]Representations of the self[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a direct copy of one’s own personality. It can take any visible form, but when conversed with, it clearly adopts an identical vocabulary and set of mannerisms to one’s own consciousness. This entity will often take on a similar appearance to oneself, but could theoretically take on any other appearance too. During this experience, there is also a distinct feeling that one's own consciousness is somehow being mirrored and duplicated into the hallucinated autonomous entity that is being interacted with.[/p]\n",

In contrast, a person with a negative mindset may experience hateful, sinister, and mocking entities.[/p]\\n\\n[p]In terms of their overall visibility and clarity, this effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 3 different levels of intensity described below:[/p]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 1\\\" header=\\\"Vaguely defined presence\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#AAAAAA\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]At the lowest level, autonomous entities generally consist of poorly defined outlines and silhoettes that are barely distinguishable from the background behind them. However, this is still often accompanied by a distinct feeling of \\\"[int-link to=\\\"/effects/sensed-presence\\\"]sensed presence[/int-link]\\\".[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 2\\\" header=\\\"Partially defined presence\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#8f8e8d\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]At this level, autonomous entities become entirely visible within one’s visual field and distinguishable from their background, but are not fully defined in their appearance. This means that, although clearly visible, they do not look completely detailed and are often blurry or semi-translucent. At this point, it also becomes more common to feel a sense of general intent and personality attributed to the entity.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 3\\\" header=\\\"Fully defined presence\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#555554\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]At this level, the autonomous entities become distinct enough in their detail and vividness to extend beyond transparent, colourless, or blurry manifestations. They are now capable of a completely convincing and photorealistic appearance and their behaviour also becomes far more lifelike.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[p]The experience of seeing autonomous entities is also often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\\\"/effects/geometry\\\"]geometry[/int-link],[ref to=\\\"5\\\" no=\\\"2\\\" /] [int-link to=\\\"/effects/internal-hallucination\\\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], and [int-link to=\\\"/effects/delusion\\\"]delusions[/int-link]. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as [int-link to=\\\"/summaries/psychedelics/visual\\\"]psychedelics[/int-link], [int-link to=\\\"/summaries/dissociatives\\\"]dissociatives[/int-link], and [int-link to=\\\"/summaries/deliriants\\\"]deliriants[/int-link]. However, it can also occur under the influence of stimulant psychosis, with extreme sleep deprivation, or during dreams.[/p]\\n\\n[hr /]\\n\\n[h2 id=\\\"communication-styles\\\"]Communication Styles[/h2]\\n[p]Autonomous entities can communicate with a person via a combination of spoken word, “telepathy”, conceptual thoughts, choreographed movements, mathematics, and geometry-based visual linguistics that generally consist of morphing coloured structures of different textures that are innately understandable as representations of specific concepts. They will often convey insights regarding overcoming personal issues within a person’s life and will occasionally help clarify philosophical or spiritual ideas. However, more often than not, entities are very likely to speak in a cryptic or nonsensical manner that seems to have no clear meaning behind it.[/p]\\n\\n[p]It is important to note that autonomous entities can never convey novel information to the person experiencing them. For example, they cannot provide insights about the external world that a person did not already know on some level. Instead, they can only provide alternative perspectives and help build upon existing ideas. This is presumably because autonomous entities do not have access to any knowledge not already contained within one's conscious or subconscious memories.[/p]\\n\\n[p]When communicated with through spoken word, the level of coherency in which these entities can communicate with is highly variable but can be broken down into five distinct levels. These are described and listed below:[/p]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 1\\\" header=\\\"Silence\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#aaaaaa\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]At the lowest level, the effect can be described as a complete unresponsiveness from the entity and a lack of speech despite their presence within the hallucination.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 2\\\" header=\\\"Partially defined incoherent speech\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#a4a3a3\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]At this level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses and noises that almost sound like words but do not contain any real content or meaning beyond a vague sense of emotional intent.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 3\\\" header=\\\"Fully defined incoherent speech\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#878786\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]At this level, the effect can be described as audible linguistic conversational responses and noises that contain fully defined and understandable words, but often lack grammatical structure or an overall sense of general coherency.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 4\\\" header=\\\"Partially defined coherent speech\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#6d6d6c\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]At this level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain fully defined and understandable words with a partially defined grammatical structure and general coherency. It conveys its point on a level that is frequently coherent, but may not always be fully understandable and will sometimes descend into broken grammar or even gibberish.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 5\\\" header=\\\"Fully defined coherent speech\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#555554\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]At the highest level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain understandable words and fully defined grammatical sentence structures. It has an overall sense of general coherency, which conveys its point in a level of detail that is genuinely on par with that of a person’s own intellect.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[hr /]\\n\\n[h2 id=\\\"personality-types\\\"]Personality Types[/h2]\\n[p]Autonomous entities will often embody at least one of a few approximate personality types. Although there is considerable overlap between them, these personality types can typically be identified primarily through their behaviour, their appearance, and an innate sense of their character that is often felt during the interaction.[/p] \\n\\n[p]The individual types are broken down and described within the four separate categories listed below:[/p]\\n[h3 id=\\\"representations-of-characters\\\"]Representations of characters[/h3]\\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any hallucinatory character that the brain has either spontaneously generated during the trip or was already aware of at a prior time. These entities can include newly hallucinated characters of any sort, people that the person has met in real life, people that the person is aware of as existing in the real world, or characters from fictional media. These entities will usually adopt an appropriate personality and set of mannerisms to fit the chosen concept with an impressive degree of detail. An example of this might be meeting an insectoid mantis like creature that is playing the role of a shamanic teacher and acting accordingly. Another might include meeting the hallucination of a deceased loved one or a currently living family friend.[/p]\\n[h3 id=\\\"representations-of-ideas-and-concepts\\\"]Representations of ideas and concepts[/h3]\\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any known concept or idea. These specific concepts could include personified representations of abstract ideas, events, and emotions. An example of this might be meeting a mocking jester that feels and acts as if it represents one's own insecurities. Another might include meeting a group of hooded figures that feel as if they represent the very concept of organized religion itself.[/p]\\n[h3 id=\\\"representations-of-the-subconscious\\\"]Representations of the subconscious[/h3]\\n[p]This personality type can be described as an entity that may take any visible form, but is also subjectively perceived to be an autonomous controller behind the continuous generation of the details of the person’s current hallucinations. They may also be felt to simultaneously control or manage one’s current perspective, personality, and internally stored model of reality. When interacted with, this category of entity can often possess abilities that allow them to directly alter and manipulate one’s current experiences. They commonly want to teach or guide the person and will operate under the assumption that they know what is best for them. However, although a relatively common experience, it still cannot be known whether this type of autonomous entity is genuinely a representation of the \\\"subconscious\\\" or is merely an approximation that behaves in a convincing manner.[/p]\\n[h3 id=\\\"representations-of-the-self\\\"]Representations of the self[/h3]\\n[p]This personality type can be described as a direct copy of one’s own personality. It can take any visible form, but when conversed with, it clearly adopts an identical vocabulary and set of mannerisms to one’s own consciousness. This entity will often take on a similar appearance to oneself, but could theoretically take on any other appearance too. During this experience, there is also a distinct feeling that one's own consciousness is somehow being mirrored and duplicated into the hallucinated autonomous entity that is being interacted with.[/p]\\n\"}]",

In regards to this particular notion, it is then often asserted that consciousness must be an antenna of sorts that receives either all or some of its subjective experiences from that of an unknown interdimensional source. Furthermore, the source of this received input is sometimes said to be adjustable depending on the person's brain state, with substances such as psychedelics simply tuning our consciousness into the analogous equivalent of a different radio station or TV channel.

Instead, I am quite sure that they are simply the psychedelic equivalent of the various characters and beings that most people commonly encounter within their dreams. Although it could be argued that autonomous entities are too characteristically different from that of dream characters to possibly be a result of the same neurological processes, I think that these differences in their appearance and behaviour are largely the result of the many other psychedelic effects that are simultaneously occurring during these encounters. The most notable one is geometry, which causes the hallucination to be comprised of the otherworldly shapes and patterns that provide autonomous entities with their distinctly \\\"hyperspatial\\\" aesthetic.

These questions have included math problems, metaphysical questions, philosophical questions, and queries pertaining to their general nature as beings inhabiting their particular world. However, each attempt at doing so has resulted in the entities simply ignoring the question, arrogantly scoffing at the absurdity of us asking them such a trivial thing, or replying with vague ambiguous wording that the person's own mind could have easily come up with.

For example, within the moment that entities are presenting themselves, I believe that to varying degrees, they are genuinely conscious agents that the brain is simulating alongside our own. It does not seem unreasonable to me that if the brain can simulate one conscious agent during everyday sobriety, that in certain extenuating circumstances, such as mental illnesses, dream states, and hallucinogenic experiences, it could also temporarily allocate resources into simultaneously simulating other conscious agents.

I find this particularly fascinating in conjunction with the knowledge that they also commonly present themselves as representative embodiments of various aspects of the subconscious mind. These aspects can include things such as: facets of our personality, emotions, neurological processes, past experiences, and specific concepts. Although I may well be wrong, this suggests to me that at least to some extent, this experience may therefore allow people to potentially interact and communicate with facets of their consciousness in a manner that would otherwise be entirely impossible without the use of hallucinogenic substances.[/p][/quote]\"}]",

It does not seem unreasonable to me that if the brain can simulate one conscious agent during everyday sobriety, that in certain extenuating circumstances, such as mental illnesses, dream states, and hallucinogenic experiences, it could also temporarily allocate resources into simultaneously simulating other conscious agents. [/p]\n\n[p]Many autonomous entities would pass the [ext-link to=\"/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test\"]Turing test[/ext-link] if interviewed. I find this particularly fascinating in conjunction with the knowledge that they also commonly present themselves as representative embodiments of various aspects of the subconscious mind. These aspects can include things such as: facets of our personality, emotions, neurological processes, past experiences, and specific concepts. Although I may well be wrong, this suggests to me that at least to some extent, this experience may therefore allow people to potentially interact and communicate with facets of their consciousness in a manner that would otherwise be entirely impossible without the use of hallucinogenic substances.[/p][/quote]",

During this process, the geometry naturally drifts across the visual field while fluidly transitioning through many distinct states and forms.[/p]\n\n[p]At greater levels of intensity, these geometric forms can often become structured and organized in a manner that presents genuine information to the person experiencing them, far beyond the perception of meaningless (though complex) shapes and colours. These geometric representations often feel as though they depict extraordinarily detailed and innately understandable information about specific concepts and neurological processes that occur within the brain. This particular aspect of geometry can lead into incredibly complex and nuanced experiences such as [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-exposure-to-inner-mechanics-of-consciousness\"]visual exposure to inner mechanics of consciousness[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-exposure-to-semantic-concept-network\"]visual exposure to semantic concept network[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]Geometry is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/environmental-patterning\"]environmental patterning[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/drifting\"]drifting[/int-link]. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/visual\"]psychedelic[/int-link] compounds such as LSD, psilocybin, and mescaline. However, it can also occur to a lesser extent under the influence of cannabis, MDMA, and [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociatives[/int-link].\n[captioned-image src=\"/img/gallery/hastings country park geometry.jpg\" width=\"700\" border=\"true\" artist=\"Josie Kins\" title=\"LSD in Hastings Country Park\" caption=\"This replication serves as an image example for level 4 open eye psychedelic geometry.\" align=\"center\" /]\nThis effect is capable of manifesting itself across seven different levels of intensity. These tend to depend on the dosage, but can fluctuate wildly in their intensity due to external triggers such as a person's set and setting. The individual levels are defined below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Visual Noise\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, which may be experienced in a completely sober state, geometry has not yet taken form and is thus perceived as visual noise (also known as visual snow or visual static), combined with stray light and dark red regions that can be seen under the eyelids.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Motion and Colour\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, which is also obtainable without hallucinogens, the effect can be described as unstructured regions of sudden flashes and clouds of colour. These are comparable to phosphenes, which can be experienced in a sober state by rubbing or applying pressure on or near the closed eyes.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Partially Defined Geometry\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, relatively complex shapes and patterns with a vague structure begin to form.

This results in a complete perceptual disconnection from one's sense of sight, which can be described as the experience of being completely blinded and unable to tell whether the eyes are open or closed due to a total lack of sensory input. During this state, the effect often leads one into the experience of finding themselves floating through a dark and mostly empty hallucinatory void.[/p]\n\n[subarticle id=\"holes-spaces-voids\"][h2]Holes, spaces, and voids[/h2][/subarticle]\n[p][i]Holes, spaces and voids[/i] are a sub-component of visual disconnection that manifest when it has become all-encompassing in its intensity. This experience is more commonly known as a \"K-hole\"[ref to=\"1\" /][ref to=\"2\" /] and is generally discussed as something that is specifically associated with ketamine, despite being present within most traditional dissociatives. A K-hole can be described as the place a person finds themselves in once visual disconnection becomes powerful enough to leave the person incapable of receiving external sensory input, replacing their visual input with a space that subjectively feels as if it is outside of normal reality.[/p]\n[captioned-image src=\"/img/gallery/khole.jpg\" width=\"700\" border=\"true\" artist=\"Josie Kins\" title=\"The K-hole\" caption=\"This replication serves as a third person perspective replication of a K-hole experience.\" align=\"center\" /]\n[p]The visual appearance of this space, hole, or void can be described as a vast, mostly empty and darkened chamber that often feels and appears to be infinite in size. This space is usually dark black in its colour, but can occasionally display itself with large patches of slow-moving amorphous colour clouds or subtle geometric patterns across its horizon. At its higher levels, these voids are often populated with hallucinatory structures, which are comprehensively described and documented in the subsection below.[/p]\n\n[p]Alongside this visual experience, changes in gravity and a powerful sense of tactile disconnection are also usually present. This can result in one feeling as if they are undergoing an out-of-body experience while weightlessly floating through a void over great distances in a variety of different speeds, directions, and orientations. This is a feeling that is interpreted by many people as floating through space or the night sky.[/p]\n\n[subarticle id=\"structures\"][h2]Structures[/h2][/subarticle]\n[p]Structures are the only feature found within what would otherwise be completely empty and uninhabited voids. These manifest as monolithic 3-dimensional shapes or structures of an infinite variety and size that float above, below, around, or in front of a person as they gradually zoom, rotate, transform, or pan into focus, gradually unveiling before the person's line of sight.[/p]\n\n[captioned-image gfycat=\"SeparateTepidHeifer\" title=\"Basic Structures\" artist=\"StasConstantine\" border=\"true\" caption=\"This animation serves as some examples of level 3 hallucinatory structures within a standard dissociative void\" align=\"center\" width=\"705\" height=\"430\" /]\n\n[p]These structures can take the form of any shape, but common examples include vast and giant pillars, columns, tunnels, blocks, buildings, slides, monuments, wheels, pyramids, caves, and a variety of abstract shapes.

In terms of its appearance, this state is extremely hard to describe but has many subjective similarities to level 8A geometry. The structure can take any form, but usually appear as intricately shaped machine-like structures that are seemingly infinite in size and can convey huge amounts of innately understandable information. This experience is not just perceived through one's sense of sight but is also physically felt in an incomprehensible level of detail that manifests itself as complex cognitive and tactile sensations. The structure as a whole and the information it conveys are often innately interpreted as perceiving a structural representation of “the universe” or “everything”.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]Structures typically display themselves anywhere between 30 seconds to several minutes before the person experiencing them slips back into reality or into the presence of another structure. In terms of how these structures shift between each other, their transition processes can be broken down into 4 basic categories. These are described and documented below:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li][b]Structural transformations[/b] - Structures can switch between each other by transforming or shapeshifting in a static and comprehensible way. This is something that usually unfolds in a gradual step-by-step morphing process.[/li]\n[li][b]Structural panning[/b] - Structures can switch between each other by remaining completely static in their shape and simply panning out of view until they are no longer within one's field of vision. It’s from here that another structure usually comes into view from outside of one's peripheral vision within a few seconds to a couple of minutes.[/li]\n[li][b]Structural disintegration[/b] - Structures can switch between each other by disassembling into many tiny sections that resemble pixels, or building blocks. This occurs in a manner that is reminiscent of smoke or dust blowing in the wind. When forming through this style, the structure will appear to assemble itself step-by-step, becoming increasingly complex as it occurs.[/li]\n[li][b]Traveling over great distances[/b] - The third method of transitioning is experienced when the structures appear to be stationary whilst one is floating silently between them over what can feel like extreme physical distances. This floating is sometimes felt to occur on an invisible rail through the vast and infinite dissociative hole.\"[/li]\n[/ul]",

They appear to be comprised of semi-transparent condensed colour and are seen as ill-defined or out of focus around their edges. In terms of size, these structures appear to be extremely large, stretching out up to seemingly hundreds of meters.[/headered-textbox]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined 3-dimensional structures\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, structures become fully defined in their shape, edges, lighting, shadow, and detail. They often appear to be made of solid and dense realistic materials such as stone and metal. In terms of their size, they are capable of appearing as thousands of miles long and are often extremely complex in terms of their shape and texture.[/headered-textbox]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Structural machine-universes\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At its highest level, hallucinatory structures can be described as the sensation of seeing that which is subjectively perceived as the entire universe condensed into an infinitely vast and intricate ever-shifting machine structure. In terms of its appearance, this state is extremely hard to describe but has many subjective similarities to level 8A geometry. The structure can take any form, but usually appear as intricately shaped machine-like structures that are seemingly infinite in size and can convey huge amounts of innately understandable information. This experience is not just perceived through one's sense of sight but is also physically felt in an incomprehensible level of detail that manifests itself as complex cognitive and tactile sensations. The structure as a whole and the information it conveys are often innately interpreted as perceiving a structural representation of “the universe” or “everything”.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]Structures typically display themselves anywhere between 30 seconds to several minutes before the person experiencing them slips back into reality or into the presence of another structure. In terms of how these structures shift between each other, their transition processes can be broken down into 4 basic categories. These are described and documented below:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li][b]Structural transformations[/b] - Structures can switch between each other by transforming or shapeshifting in a static and comprehensible way. This is something that usually unfolds in a gradual step-by-step morphing process.[/li]\n[li][b]Structural panning[/b] - Structures can switch between each other by remaining completely static in their shape and simply panning out of view until they are no longer within one's field of vision. It’s from here that another structure usually comes into view from outside of one's peripheral vision within a few seconds to a couple of minutes.[/li]\n[li][b]Structural disintegration[/b] - Structures can switch between each other by disassembling into many tiny sections that resemble pixels, or building blocks. This occurs in a manner that is reminiscent of smoke or dust blowing in the wind. When forming through this style, the structure will appear to assemble itself step-by-step, becoming increasingly complex as it occurs.[/li]\n[li][b]Traveling over great distances[/b] - The third method of transitioning is experienced when the structures appear to be stationary whilst one is floating silently between them over what can feel like extreme physical distances. This floating is sometimes felt to occur on an invisible rail through the vast and infinite dissociative hole.\"[/li]\n[/ul]"

These are often perceived as linear and coherent plots that occur in a logical sequence by leading into other events through normal cause and effect. However, they are equally likely to present themselves as completely nonsensical and incoherent. For example, they may consist of nonlinear or spontaneous events that are capable of ending, starting, and changing between each other repeatedly in quick succession.[/p]\n\n[p]These hallucinated plots can consist of new experiences that are completely unlike the real world, old experiences such as accurate memory replays, or a combination of the two.

    "summary_raw": "Depression medically encompasses a large variety of different mood disorders whose common features are a sad, empty, or irritable mood co-occurring with bodily and cognitive changes that significantly disrupt an individual's ability to function. Within the context of psychoactive substance usage, depressivity is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as anxiety, irritability and dysphoria.",
    "analysis_raw": "[p] Unless otherwise noted, the studies referenced here will refer to Depression as it is traditionally defined in medical and scientific literature AKA Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). [/p]\n\n[p] Major depression affects 5-20% of the population at some point in their life.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"2\" /] It results from the combination of genetics and environments with a heritability of greater than 30%. Common environmental influences (parenting style, socioeconomic status, or local environmental qualities) are quite small; however this does not mean these influences are irrelevant. What seems to matter is how a specific individual interacts with their environment across developmental stages.[ref to=\"5\" no=\"1\" /] Stressful life events are significantly associated with depression.[ref to=\"6\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Depression is a life-threatening disorder. Both depression and subclinical depression increase all-cause mortality similarly; [ref to=\"7\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"8\" no=\"1\" /]however subclinical depression does not have an exact definition yet (making it harder to study). The impact depression has on quality of life is comparable or greater than other chronic medical illnesses.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"3\" /] [/p]\n\n[h3] Cognitive Impairment [/h3]\n\n[p] Cognitive impairment is a core feature of depression that remains after remission and cannot be considered a result of low mood.[ref to=\"9\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"10\" no=\"1\" /]Although there is some evidence associating depressivity and functionality, depression severity accounts for -at most- 10% of the variability in cognitive dysfunction. Both age of onset and depression severity also modify this effect’s magnitude and what cognitive deficits arise.[ref to=\"11\" no=\"1\" /]As a generality (not developed in parallel), more severe depression correlates with significant decreases in cognitive performance. [ref to=\"9\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"11\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] Moderate decrease: Executive function, Attention, Episodic memory (not semantic or visuo-spatial) [/li]\n  [li] Mild decrease: Processing speed [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]These cognitive deficits are significantly associated with poor psychosocial functioning (psychological factors combined with the surrounding social environment). [/p]\n\n[h3] Psychosocial impairment [/h3]\n\n[p] Psychosocial impairment is also a core feature of depression that remains after remission. Psychosocial stressors are associated with the onset, severity, and progression of MDD.[ref to=\"12\" no=\"1\" /]More severe depression can be considered a disability, or disorder, of psychosocial function.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"4\" /]Even brief psychosocial interventions in the form of collaborative care (e.g. a telephone call reminding to take medication) may be comparably effective to more intensive forms of face-to-face psychotherapy.[ref to=\"13\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Improving cognitive deficits may also improve psychosocial functioning. Although impaired attention and executive functions remain in patients whose depressive symptoms alleviate, memory functions may improve to only a small deficit. [ref to=\"9\" no=\"3\" /] Improvements in mood are most closely related to improvements in verbal memory, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed. [/p]\n\n[h3] Immune System [/h3] \n\n[p] Depression is accompanied by immune system dysregulation and activation of the body’s inflammatory response system.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"5\" /] [ref to=\"7\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"14\" no=\"1\" /] Specific biomarkers have small but significantly higher concentrations associated with the incidence and severity of depression. [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) [ref to=\"3\" no=\"6\" /] [/li]\n  [li] Chemokines for Monocyte Chemotactic Protein (MCP)-1/CCL2 [ref to=\"14\" no=\"2\" /] [/li]\n  [li] C Reactive protein[ref to=\"7\" no=\"3\" /] and its interleukin precursors: [/li]\n  [li] Interleukin-6 (IL-6), associated with reduced hippocampal grey matter volume and is increased with higher BMI via Leptin[ref to=\"3\" no=\"7\" /] [ref to=\"7\" no=\"4\" /] [/li]\n  [li] IL-1ra,[ref to=\"7\" no=\"5\" /] but not IL1-β[ref to=\"3\" no=\"8\" /] | IL1 is difficult to detect in plasma since it works primarily at the local site of inflammation and new forms are still being discovered. [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p] It is difficult to say how biological sex interacts due to increasing the number of females in a sample causing the relationship between depression and inflammation to become nonsignificant.[ref to=\"7\" no=\"6\" /]Estrogen interacts with CRP and IL6, thus fluctuations in menstrual cycles and hormonal contraceptives may affect these results. Yet, overall the fundamental genetic architecture appears the same across samples and genders.[ref to=\"5\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] These proinflammatory small protein messengers, called cytokines, increase indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression in both central and peripheral immune-competent cells. IDO increases the synthesis of kynurenine from dietary tryptophan, so this may cause a decrease in tryptophan availability. Tryptophan is required to synthesize serotonin and melatonin.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"9\" /]Additionally, there is no evidence the serotonin transporter genotype alone or in interaction with stressful life events is associated with an elevated risk of depression.[ref to=\"6\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Kynurenine also produces endogenous NMDA agonist metabolites that could disrupt neurotransmission along glutaminergic pathways and lead to excitotoxicity in the form of hippocampal neuron damage/death.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"10\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Within the central nervous system, proinflammatory cytokines play important roles in the body’s stress response system and within the regulation of neurogenesis.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"11\" /]\n[markdown text=\"#### HPA AXIS\" /]Stress response is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"12\" /]The HPA axis allows organisms to adapt to physical and psychosocial changes in their environments. There is a substantial link between MDD and HPA abnormalities and it is well established that approximately half of depressed patients have HPA axis hyperactivity.[ref to=\"10\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"12\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone commonly pointed to as mediating stress response, is just one component of the complex HPA system; note that total plasma cortisol does not represent the bioactive or 'free' portion of cortisol that is available to bind to target receptors and produce physiological effects. Regardless, it is typical for higher cortisol to inhibit this adaptation mechanism in the hippocampus. [/p]\n\n[p] Adaptation can be separated into three phases, each with different physiological processes. Mineralocorticoid receptors regulate cortisol during periods of low HPA activity. Glucocorticoid receptors regulate response to stress and cortisol during high HPA activity. [/p]\n\n[ol]\n  [li] Baseline: unstimulated, non-stressed. [/li]\n  [li] Stress reactivity: cortisol increases from baseline. [/li]\n  [li] Stress recovery: following offset of the stressor, cortisol levels return to baseline. [/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[p] Major Depression Disorder patients have impaired stress reactivity and recovery, with more severe depression being more impairing. They have greatly higher overall baseline cortisol that subsequently changes less in response to new stressors. This is exhibited behaviorally through higher overall negative emotions and less emotional reactivity to new negative stimuli. [/p]\n\n[p] Time of day also has a significant effect on the relationship between depression and cortisol. Typically, in nondepressed patients, cortisol is highest in the morning and lower in the afternoon.

For example: the death of a loved one may cause great suffering, but it does not typically produce a [i]medically defined[/i] depressive episode.[ref to=\"1\" no=\"2\" /] [/p] \n\n[toc/]\n\n[p] Within the context of psychoactive substance usage, depressivity is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety\"]anxiety[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/irritability\"]irritability[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-dysphoria\"]dysphoria[/int-link]. It is most commonly induced through prolonged chronic stimulant or depressant use, during the withdrawal symptoms of almost any substance, or during the comedown/crash of a stimulant. It is associated specifically with higher alcohol consumption.[ref to=\"4\" no=\"1\" /]However, it is worth noting that substance-induced depressivity is often much shorter lasting than clinical depression, usually subsiding once the effects or withdrawal symptoms of a drug have ended. [/p] \n\n[p] If you suspect that you are experiencing symptoms of depression, it is highly recommended to seek out therapeutic medical attention and/or a support group. Additionally, you may want to read our [int-link to=\"/effects/depression-reduction\"]depression reduction[/int-link] effect and [int-link to=\"/effects/psychedelic-therapy\"]Psychedelic Therapy[/int-link] review. [/p] \n\n[p] It is worth noting that depression as an effect has an unfortunately non-specific definition. It is due to this that there are a number of other relevant terms which should be taken into account when trying to understand this state of mind. These are listed and described below:\n\n[hr/]\n[h2 id=\"depressive-conditions\"]Known Depressive Conditions[/h2]\n\n[h3 id=\"depressivity\"]Depressivity[/h3]\nDepressivity is medically recognized as feelings of being intensely sad, miserable, and/or hopeless. Some patients describe an [int-link to=\"/effects/emotion-suppression\"]absence of feelings[/int-link] and/or [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-dysphoria\"]dysphoria[/int-link]; difficulty recovering from such moods; pessimism about the future; pervasive shame and/or guilt; feelings of inferior self-worth; and thoughts of suicide and suicidal behavior.[ref to=\"2\" no=\"1\" /]Depressive symptoms may include [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-fatigue\"]fatigue[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/focus-suppression\"]lack of ability to concentrate[/int-link], or significant changes in weight or sleep.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"major-depressive-disorder\"] Major Depressive Disorder [/h3] \n\n[p]Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is medically recognized as discrete episodes of depressivity lasting at least two weeks (although most episodes last considerably longer).[ref to=\"1\" no=\"3\" /]This is the traditional characterization for the term medical term depression. [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"dysthymia\"] Dysthymia [/h3] \n\n[p] Dysthymia is medically recognized as a chronic major depressive disorder and is typically diagnosed after two years of continued mood disturbance.[ref to=\"1\" no=\"4\" /][ref to=\"2\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"acute-depressivity\"] Acute depressivity [/h3]\n\n[p] Acute depressivity (colloquially referred to as \"feeling depressed\"), when indicated by either self-report or observation made by others, encompasses the following symptoms: [/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li] Feeling intensely sad, miserable, and/or hopeless along with pessimism about the future. [/li]\n[li] Anhedonia: a markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities. [/li]\n[li] Unintentional weight losses and gains. [/li]\n[li] Inability to sleep or sleeping too much. [/li]\n[li] Restlessness or feeling slowed down. [/li]\n[li] Intense fatigue or loss of energy. [/li]\n[li] Feelings worthless or excessive/inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) [/li]\n[li] Diminished ability to think/concentrate, or indecisiveness. [/li]\n[li] Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying). [/li]\n[li] Recurrent suicidal ideation: without a specific plan, having a plan, or a suicide attempt. [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p] For a diagnosis of major depressive disorder to be accurate, the symptoms must cause readily observable distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning for an extended period of time. The episode must not be better explained by a different mood disorder. The symptoms also cannot be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. [/p]\n\n[hr/]\n[h2 id=\"analysis\"]Analysis[/h2]\n\n[p] Unless otherwise noted, the studies referenced here will refer to Depression as it is traditionally defined in medical and scientific literature AKA Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). [/p]\n\n[p] Major depression affects 5-20% of the population at some point in their life.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"2\" /] It results from the combination of genetics and environments with a heritability of greater than 30%. Common environmental influences (parenting style, socioeconomic status, or local environmental qualities) are quite small; however this does not mean these influences are irrelevant. What seems to matter is how a specific individual interacts with their environment across developmental stages.[ref to=\"5\" no=\"1\" /] Stressful life events are significantly associated with depression.[ref to=\"6\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Depression is a life-threatening disorder. Both depression and subclinical depression increase all-cause mortality similarly; [ref to=\"7\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"8\" no=\"1\" /]however subclinical depression does not have an exact definition yet (making it harder to study). The impact depression has on quality of life is comparable or greater than other chronic medical illnesses.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"3\" /] [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"cognitive-impairment\"] Cognitive Impairment [/h3]\n\n[p] Cognitive impairment is a core feature of depression that remains after remission and cannot be considered a result of low mood.[ref to=\"9\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"10\" no=\"1\" /]Although there is some evidence associating depressivity and functionality, depression severity accounts for -at most- 10% of the variability in cognitive dysfunction. Both age of onset and depression severity also modify this effect’s magnitude and what cognitive deficits arise.[ref to=\"11\" no=\"1\" /]As a generality (not developed in parallel), more severe depression correlates with significant decreases in cognitive performance. [ref to=\"9\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"11\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] Moderate decrease: Executive function, Attention, Episodic memory (not semantic or visuo-spatial) [/li]\n  [li] Mild decrease: Processing speed [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]These cognitive deficits are significantly associated with poor psychosocial functioning (psychological factors combined with the surrounding social environment). [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"psychosocial-impairment\"] Psychosocial impairment [/h3]\n\n[p] Psychosocial impairment is also a core feature of depression that remains after remission. Psychosocial stressors are associated with the onset, severity, and progression of MDD.[ref to=\"12\" no=\"1\" /]More severe depression can be considered a disability, or disorder, of psychosocial function.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"4\" /]Even brief psychosocial interventions in the form of collaborative care (e.g. a telephone call reminding to take medication) may be comparably effective to more intensive forms of face-to-face psychotherapy.[ref to=\"13\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Improving cognitive deficits may also improve psychosocial functioning. Although impaired attention and executive functions remain in patients whose depressive symptoms alleviate, memory functions may improve to only a small deficit. [ref to=\"9\" no=\"3\" /] Improvements in mood are most closely related to improvements in verbal memory, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed. [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"immune-system\"] Immune System [/h3] \n\n[p] Depression is accompanied by immune system dysregulation and activation of the body’s inflammatory response system.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"5\" /] [ref to=\"7\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"14\" no=\"1\" /] Specific biomarkers have small but significantly higher concentrations associated with the incidence and severity of depression. [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) [ref to=\"3\" no=\"6\" /] [/li]\n  [li] Chemokines for Monocyte Chemotactic Protein (MCP)-1/CCL2 [ref to=\"14\" no=\"2\" /] [/li]\n  [li] C Reactive protein[ref to=\"7\" no=\"3\" /] and its interleukin precursors: [/li]\n  [li] Interleukin-6 (IL-6), associated with reduced hippocampal grey matter volume and is increased with higher BMI via Leptin[ref to=\"3\" no=\"7\" /] [ref to=\"7\" no=\"4\" /] [/li]\n  [li] IL-1ra,[ref to=\"7\" no=\"5\" /] but not IL1-β[ref to=\"3\" no=\"8\" /] | IL1 is difficult to detect in plasma since it works primarily at the local site of inflammation and new forms are still being discovered. [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p] It is difficult to say how biological sex interacts due to increasing the number of females in a sample causing the relationship between depression and inflammation to become nonsignificant.[ref to=\"7\" no=\"6\" /]Estrogen interacts with CRP and IL6, thus fluctuations in menstrual cycles and hormonal contraceptives may affect these results. Yet, overall the fundamental genetic architecture appears the same across samples and genders.[ref to=\"5\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] These proinflammatory small protein messengers, called cytokines, increase indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression in both central and peripheral immune-competent cells. IDO increases the synthesis of kynurenine from dietary tryptophan, so this may cause a decrease in tryptophan availability. Tryptophan is required to synthesize serotonin and melatonin.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"9\" /]Additionally, there is no evidence the serotonin transporter genotype alone or in interaction with stressful life events is associated with an elevated risk of depression.[ref to=\"6\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Kynurenine also produces endogenous NMDA agonist metabolites that could disrupt neurotransmission along glutaminergic pathways and lead to excitotoxicity in the form of hippocampal neuron damage/death.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"10\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Within the central nervous system, proinflammatory cytokines play important roles in the body’s stress response system and within the regulation of neurogenesis.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"11\" /]\n[markdown text=\"#### HPA AXIS\" /]Stress response is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"12\" /]The HPA axis allows organisms to adapt to physical and psychosocial changes in their environments. There is a substantial link between MDD and HPA abnormalities and it is well established that approximately half of depressed patients have HPA axis hyperactivity.[ref to=\"10\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"12\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone commonly pointed to as mediating stress response, is just one component of the complex HPA system; note that total plasma cortisol does not represent the bioactive or 'free' portion of cortisol that is available to bind to target receptors and produce physiological effects. Regardless, it is typical for higher cortisol to inhibit this adaptation mechanism in the hippocampus. [/p]\n\n[p] Adaptation can be separated into three phases, each with different physiological processes. Mineralocorticoid receptors regulate cortisol during periods of low HPA activity. Glucocorticoid receptors regulate response to stress and cortisol during high HPA activity. [/p]\n\n[ol]\n  [li] Baseline: unstimulated, non-stressed. [/li]\n  [li] Stress reactivity: cortisol increases from baseline. [/li]\n  [li] Stress recovery: following offset of the stressor, cortisol levels return to baseline. [/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[p] Major Depression Disorder patients have impaired stress reactivity and recovery, with more severe depression being more impairing. They have greatly higher overall baseline cortisol that subsequently changes less in response to new stressors. This is exhibited behaviorally through higher overall negative emotions and less emotional reactivity to new negative stimuli. [/p]\n\n[p] Time of day also has a significant effect on the relationship between depression and cortisol. Typically, in nondepressed patients, cortisol is highest in the morning and lower in the afternoon. MDD patients have much lower baseline baseline cortisol levels in the morning and higher baselines in the afternoon.[ref to=\"12\" no=\"3\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Stress robustly reduces neurogenesis and the genes responsible for it in the brain. Antidepressants almost universally promote neurogenesis and neurotrophic factor gene expression.[ref to=\"15\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"hippocampus-reduction\"] Hippocampus Reduction [/h3]\n\n[p] Although not only specific to depression, depressed patients display smaller hippocampus volume.[ref to=\"10\" no=\"3\" /][ref to=\"15\" no=\"2\" /]The arrow of causality is not entirely clear: does depression cause shrinkage or are people with a smaller hippocampus more susceptible to depression? [/p] \n\n[p] Although the mechanism of action is still undetermined, serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels are abnormally low in MDD and elevate during antidepressant treatment. This potentially makes it a good biomarker to indicate the presence of depression and responsiveness to antidepressants.[ref to=\"15\" no=\"3\" /][ref to=\"16\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Postmortem studies on patients with MDD or Bipolar Disorder suggest depression is a disorder of neuroplasticity and cellular resilience. It is not a neurodegenerative disease. [ref to=\"10\" no=\"4\" /] [/p]"

These can be described as spontaneous moving or still images of scenes, concepts, places, or anything one could imagine. The imagery is manifested in varying levels of realism ranging from ill-defined and cartoon-like to wholly realistic. They rarely hold their form for more than a few seconds before fading or shifting into another image. It is worth noting that this level of intensity occurs in a manner similar to that of hypnagogia, the state between sleep and wakefulness.[/p]\n\n[p]At [i]higher levels[/i], internal hallucinations become increasingly elaborate as they eventually become all-encompassing, fully-fledged 3D scenes that surround the person in a manner similar to that of [int-link to=\"/effects/dreams\"]dreams[/int-link]. This can create the feeling that one has \"broken-through\" into another reality. The things that occur within this perceived alternate reality can be anything, but fall under common archetypes such as contact with [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link], alongside a wide variety of [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]imagined landscapes[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]scenarios[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]This effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 5 different levels of intensity described below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Enhancement of mental visualization\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, internal hallucinations can be defined as the distinct enhancement of mental visualisation that a person drifts into while daydreaming or using their imagination. It can be described as a short-term detachment from one’s immediate surroundings; during which, a person’s contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by an ill-defined fantasy. The details of this internal visualisation are chosen in a slightly spontaneous or autonomous nature, but are mostly consciously controlled by the content of one’s current thought stream.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, internal hallucinations consist of partially defined, blurred, and faded imagery within a person’s visual field. This is where the content of these hallucinations usually becomes more spontaneous in nature and out of the person’s conscious control.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the vividness and intensity increases in a fashion that renders the imagery seen within one’s visual field as fully defined and realistic in its appearance.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the vividness, scope, and intensity of the hallucinations become all-encompassing in a way that displays momentary flashes of scenes that surround the person in an immersive environment, similar to that of a vague dream. Although all-encompassing, they are often blurred or transparent in appearance and the person’s physical senses remain partially connected to the real world.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the highest level, the internal hallucinations further increase to become all-encompassing in a manner that displays long-lasting scenes surrounding the person with an explorable and fully immersive environment similar to that of a dream. This occurs in a fashion that is fully detailed and highly vivid in its appearance. Typically, it also occurs alongside relevant [int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-hallucination\"]auditory[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/tactile-hallucination\"]tactile hallucinations[/int-link], as well as the sensation that a person has become completely disconnected from their physical body.[/headered-textbox]\n\nOutside of this levelling system, the subjective intensity of internal hallucinations are not only dependent on their detail or level of immersion, but also upon the speed and rate at which they successively occur between each other. For example, during the experience of internal hallucinations, it is possible to find oneself in a state that presents a relentless stream of intensely vivid hallucinations. This occurs at such a rapid rate that it eventually becomes psychologically exhausting to endure them, regardless of their thematic content. The sheer amount of content experienced in this state often results in powerful [int-link to=\"/effects/time-distortion?s=Time-dilation\"]time dilation[/int-link], which seems to stem from the fact that abnormally large amounts of experiences are being felt in very short periods of time. This is also consistently accompanied by states of sensory overload and [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link] in a manner that can subjectively feel as if it is a consequence of the brain allocating all of its processing power into rendering hallucinations at the expense of other cognitive faculties.\n\nThe content within these internal hallucinations can be further broken down into four distinct sub-components.

It can be described as a short-term detachment from one’s immediate surroundings; during which, a person’s contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by an ill-defined fantasy. The details of this internal visualisation are chosen in a slightly spontaneous or autonomous nature, but are mostly consciously controlled by the content of one’s current thought stream.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 2\\\" header=\\\"Partially defined imagery\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#a4a3a3\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]At this level, internal hallucinations consist of partially defined, blurred, and faded imagery within a person’s visual field. This is where the content of these hallucinations usually becomes more spontaneous in nature and out of the person’s conscious control.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 3\\\" header=\\\"Fully defined imagery\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#878786\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]At this level, the vividness and intensity increases in a fashion that renders the imagery seen within one’s visual field as fully defined and realistic in its appearance.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 4\\\" header=\\\"Partially defined immersion\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#6d6d6c\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]At this level, the vividness, scope, and intensity of the hallucinations become all-encompassing in a way that displays momentary flashes of scenes that surround the person in an immersive environment, similar to that of a vague dream. Although all-encompassing, they are often blurred or transparent in appearance and the person’s physical senses remain partially connected to the real world.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 5\\\" header=\\\"Fully defined immersion\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#555554\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]At the highest level, the internal hallucinations further increase to become all-encompassing in a manner that displays long-lasting scenes surrounding the person with an explorable and fully immersive environment similar to that of a dream. This occurs in a fashion that is fully detailed and highly vivid in its appearance. Typically, it also occurs alongside relevant [int-link to=\\\"/effects/auditory-hallucination\\\"]auditory[/int-link] and [int-link to=\\\"/effects/tactile-hallucination\\\"]tactile hallucinations[/int-link], as well as the sensation that a person has become completely disconnected from their physical body.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\nOutside of this levelling system, the subjective intensity of internal hallucinations are not only dependent on their detail or level of immersion, but also upon the speed and rate at which they successively occur between each other. For example, during the experience of internal hallucinations, it is possible to find oneself in a state that presents a relentless stream of intensely vivid hallucinations. This occurs at such a rapid rate that it eventually becomes psychologically exhausting to endure them, regardless of their thematic content. The sheer amount of content experienced in this state often results in powerful [int-link to=\\\"/effects/time-distortion?s=Time-dilation\\\"]time dilation[/int-link], which seems to stem from the fact that abnormally large amounts of experiences are being felt in very short periods of time. This is also consistently accompanied by states of sensory overload and [int-link to=\\\"/effects/ego-death\\\"]ego death[/int-link] in a manner that can subjectively feel as if it is a consequence of the brain allocating all of its processing power into rendering hallucinations at the expense of other cognitive faculties.\\n\\nThe content within these internal hallucinations can be further broken down into four distinct sub-components. These are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, each of which are listed below:\\n\\n[ul]\\n[li][b][int-link to=\\\"/effects/autonomous-entity/\\\"]Autonomous entities[/int-link][/b][/li]\\n[li][b][int-link to=\\\"/effects/perspective-hallucination/\\\"]Perspective hallucinations[/int-link][/b][/li]\\n[li][b][int-link to=\\\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\\\"]Scenarios and plots[/int-link][/b][/li]\\n[li][b][int-link to=\\\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes/\\\"]Settings, Sceneries, and Landscapes[/int-link][/b][/li]\\n[/ul]\\n\\nIt is worth noting that the content, style, and general behaviour of an internal hallucination is often largely dependent on the emotional state of the person experiencing it.

However, they may also manifest as a non-linear, nonsensical, and continuously changing layout that does not obey the laws of physics. The chosen locations, appearance, and style of these settings may be entirely new and previously unseen locations; however, there is a large influence towards replicating and combining real-life locations stored within a person's memories. There are some common themes and archetypes within this component which generally include:[/p]\n\n[p][i]Jungles, rainforests, deserts, ice-scapes, cities, natural environments, caves, space habitats, vast structures, civilizations, technological utopias, ancient ruins, machinescapes, historical settings, rooms and other indoor environments, real-life locations, incomprehensible geometric landscapes, and more.[/i][/p]\n\n[p]It is worth noting that the content, style, and general behaviour of a setting is often largely dependent on the emotional state of the person experiencing it.

In contrast, amnesia does not directly affect the usage of one's short or long-term memory during its experience; instead, it renders a person incapable of recalling events after it has worn off.

It therefore is not an exhaustive examination of all delusions listed within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) that are known to occur to people who suffer from chronic psychological conditions, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. [/p]\n\n[h3] Substance-induced vs Disease-based Delusions [/h3]\n\n[p] When associated with psychoactive substance use, delusions tend to occur during the peak of a substance’s effect, though they may also occur as a result of withdrawal from substances such as benzodiazepines. In contrast to disease-based delusions, substance-induced delusions are often ‘broken-out of’ after the duration of the substance’s effect, or when they are provided enough evidence to contradict their delusion. It is rare for a delusion to persist after the effects of a substance have waned. [/p]\n\n[h3] Overvalued Beliefs [/h3] \n\n[p] It is difficult to clearly define the boundary between ‘normal’ beliefs and the delusions that occur while on psychoactive substances. In the context of psychoactive substance use, there is a discernible continuum between beliefs held while sober and the fully delusional beliefs held by those experiencing psychosis. Beliefs which are overvalued though not delusional are commonly encountered at moderate substance intensity levels. Overvalued beliefs are those which are held with unusual fervency, but are not clearly absurd, such as the paranoid conviction that one’s friends are going to call emergency services imminently. With an increase in substance intensity overvalued beliefs can potentially develop into delusions proper. [/p]\n\n[h3] Hypercertainty [/h3] \n\n[p] A common component to delusions and overvalued beliefs is a markedly increased sense of conviction in one’s beliefs. The intensity of this conviction roughly corresponds to the intensity of the substance’s effect. When conviction is increased, intuitive thinking is likewise increased, resulting in abnormally bold (and often tenuous) ideas and claims about science, metaphysics, politics, art and religion. [/p]\n\n[h3] Types of delusion [/h3] \n\n[p] Although substance-induced delusions can occur in myriad forms, they can be often categorized as belonging to particular types, the most common of which are documented and described below: [/p]\n\n[h3] Grandiose Delusions [/h3]\n\n[p] [i]Grandiose delusions[/i] are those where there is an inflated sense of personal accomplishment or status, possibly as a product of effects experienced while under the influence of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelics[/int-link] or stimulants, including [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-inflation\"]ego-inflation[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/mania\"]mania[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link]. These delusions persist for the duration of the substance’s effect, but will often be recognized as absurd upon obtaining sobriety. [/p]\n\n[p] Common grandiose themes include: [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] [b] Delusion of Transcension: [/b] The idea that one has ‘transcended to a higher level of being’ and is destined to solve the multitude of the world’s problems using extra-dimensional knowledge. [/li]\n  [li] [b] Delusion of Enlightenment: [/b] The idea that one has obtained an enlightened or god-like status comparable to The Buddha or Jesus and now comprehends the simple answer to life, the universe and everything. This individual may make claims that they have obtained a permanent enlightened status, eliminated their ego, and shall become historically noteworthy. This delusion is more common amongst users of short-acting ego death inducing hallucinogenic substances, such as DMT, nitrous oxide and salvia. [/li]\n  [li] [b] Delusion of Special Knowledge: [/b] The idea that one has figured out, due to their supreme genius, the mathematical, scientific, and philosophical problems that no one before them could. [/li]\n  [li] [b] Delusion of Special Ability: [/b] The idea that one has obtained an (often supernatural) ability that few others have. This may include abilities such as telepathy, levitation or willing the universe into producing particular outcomes. [/li]\n  [li] [b] Delusion of Precognizance [/b] The idea that one knows or can determine events that are bound to occur in the future. These predicted events can range from the mundane (‘My friend is going to call me.’) to the calamitous (‘Russia is about to invade the United States.’) [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p] While these delusions are most often applied to the individual who is undergoing the effects of the substance, they may also be applied to others, such as believing a close friend is in some way extraordinary. This projection may be influenced by a disparity in psychological states, such as that between those who are sober and those under the influence of a psychoactive substance. [/p]\n\n\n[h3] Paranoid delusions [/h3]\n\n[p] [i]Paranoid Delusions[/i] are delusions where there is a tremendous sense of fear and conviction that one is being watched, monitored, spied upon, and/or plotted against despite there being no evidence to substantiate such a claim. [/p]\n\n[p] Paranoid delusions are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] compounds.

[/p]\n\n[p] Examples of somatic delusions include: [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] The belief that one’s intestines are decomposing.

However, delusions of reference are especially common under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogens or during stimulant psychosis. [/p]\n\n[p] A list of common examples of this type of delusion are described and documented below: [/p]\n\n[ul]\n [li] Believing that people in a passing car are talking about you.

[/li]\n\n [li] Believing that the lyrics of a song are specifically about or for you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that electronic devices are sending you secret and significant messages that only you are capable of understanding. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that objects, situations, and events are being deliberately organized to convey a special or particular meaning to you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that the slightest  bodily movement of another person has a significant and deliberate meaning. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that posts on social media have hidden meanings pertaining to you.  [/li]\n\n[/ul]\n\n\n[h3] Delusions of death & dying [/h3]\n\n[p] [i]Delusions of Death & Dying[/i] are distressing, falsely-held beliefs that one is about to die, is currently dying, no longer exists, or has already died. This delusion may be a result of a diminished sense of self or identity that usually occurs during states of high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link]. [/p]\n\n[p] These delusions are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy doses of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelics[/int-link] and to a lesser extent [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociatives[/int-link].  \n[markdown text=\"#### Delusions of guilt\" /][i]Delusions of Guilt[/i] are caused by unfounded and intense feelings of remorse or guilt that lead the person to conclude that one must have committed some sort of deeply unethical act. The supposed unethical act can range from something relatively mild, such as the belief that the person has cheated on their partner; it can also be something much more serious, such as the belief that they have murdered their friends and family. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusions of guilt are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] compounds. [/p]\n\n[p] [markdown text=\"#### Delusions of Reified Fiction\" /][i]Delusions of reified fiction[/i] are the unfounded belief that something fictional, such as the plot of a TV show, film, video game, or book, is an actual real-life event. This delusion may manifest as the perception that the fictional events within media that is currently being consumed are genuinely occurring in one's immediate vicinity, or simply that the events in the media are real and currently occurring somewhere in the world. This delusion seems to be a result of high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/immersion-enhancement\"]immersion enhancement[/int-link] combined with [int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression\"]memory suppression[/int-link] creating a state of mind in which somebody is highly engrossed in media while no longer having a functional long-term memory that can recall the difference between reality and fiction.

[/p]\n\n[p] Delusional derealization is most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogens and occasionally during stimulant psychosis. [/p]\n\n[h3] Delusions of Sobriety [/h3] \n\n[p] A [i]delusion of dobriety[/i] typically involves the falsely held belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary, such as severe cognitive impairment, significant [int-link to=\"/effects/motor-control-loss\"]motor control loss[/int-link], and an inability to fully communicate with others. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusions of sobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of GABAergic compounds such as alcohol and benzodiazepines. However, in many cases, this state of mind can stem not just from the delusional belief of one's own sobriety, but also from a sense of denial that is motivated by a need to protect one's ego, or a genuine inability to identify one's own intoxication. [/p]\n\n[h3] Delusions of Permanent Unsobriety [/h3] \n\n[p] A [i]delusion of permanent unsobriety[/i] is the belief that has permanently changed the operation of their mind and will remain in an unsober state. This can also manifest as a fear that one has broken their brain through substance abuse, despite there being no convincing evidence to substantiate such a claim. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusions of permanent unsobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociative[/int-link] and occasionally [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] compounds. [/p]\n\n[h3] Shared delusions [/h3] \n\n[p] Shared delusions are when a delusional belief is experienced in a group setting and it begins to spread between individuals who are similarly intoxicated.[ref to=\"4\" no=\"1\" /] For example, if one person makes a verbal statement regarding a delusional belief that they are currently holding while in the presence of other similarly intoxicated people, they may also begin to hold the same delusion.

[/li]\n  [li] [b] Delusion of Special Ability: [/b] The idea that one has obtained an (often supernatural) ability that few others have. This may include abilities such as telepathy, levitation or willing the universe into producing particular outcomes. [/li]\n  [li] [b] Delusion of Precognizance [/b] The idea that one knows or can determine events that are bound to occur in the future. These predicted events can range from the mundane (‘My friend is going to call me.’) to the calamitous (‘Russia is about to invade the United States.’) [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p] While these delusions are most often applied to the individual who is undergoing the effects of the substance, they may also be applied to others, such as believing a close friend is in some way extraordinary. This projection may be influenced by a disparity in psychological states, such as that between those who are sober and those under the influence of a psychoactive substance. [/p]\n\n\n[h3] Paranoid delusions [/h3]\n\n[p] [i]Paranoid Delusions[/i] are delusions where there is a tremendous sense of fear and conviction that one is being watched, monitored, spied upon, and/or plotted against despite there being no evidence to substantiate such a claim. [/p]\n\n[p] Paranoid delusions are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] compounds. However, they can also occur during extreme sleep deprivation and stimulant psychosis.\n[markdown text=\"#### Somatic delusions\" /][i]Somatic Delusions[/i] are delusions that involve the belief that the body, or part of it, is missing, broken, deformed, diseased or dysfunctional. These beliefs are typically bizarre and are distinguished from [int-link to=\"/effects/tactile-hallucination\"]tactile hallucination[/int-link] by seeming so real to the individual experiencing them as to cause significant emotional distress. [/p]\n\n[p] Examples of somatic delusions include: [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] The belief that one’s intestines are decomposing. [/li]\n  [li] That the tension in one’s throat is the result of the vocal cords becoming knotted. [/li]\n  [li] That there is a parasitic worm crawling around in one’s stomach. [/li]\n  [li] That a limb is dead, dying or missing.  [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[h3] Delusions of reference [/h3]\n\n[p][i]Delusions of Reference[/i] (also referred to as [i]ideas of reference[/i]) are one of the most common types of delusion. This delusion typically involves the falsely held belief that an insignificant remark, event, coincidence, or object in the person's environment is either a reaction to the individual or has significant personal meaning relating directly back to their life.[ref to=\"6\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"7\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"8\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] In psychiatry, delusions of reference form part of the diagnostic criteria for illnesses such as schizophrenia, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder. To a lesser extent, they can also be a symptom of paranoid personality disorder. However, delusions of reference are especially common under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogens or during stimulant psychosis. [/p]\n\n[p] A list of common examples of this type of delusion are described and documented below: [/p]\n\n[ul]\n [li] Believing that people in a passing car are talking about you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that people on television or in other forms of media are talking about or directly to you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that headlines and news articles are written specifically for or about you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that events (even world events) have been deliberately planned for you, or have special personal significance for you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that the lyrics of a song are specifically about or for you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that electronic devices are sending you secret and significant messages that only you are capable of understanding. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that objects, situations, and events are being deliberately organized to convey a special or particular meaning to you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that the slightest  bodily movement of another person has a significant and deliberate meaning. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that posts on social media have hidden meanings pertaining to you.  [/li]\n\n[/ul]\n\n\n[h3] Delusions of death & dying [/h3]\n\n[p] [i]Delusions of Death & Dying[/i] are distressing, falsely-held beliefs that one is about to die, is currently dying, no longer exists, or has already died. This delusion may be a result of a diminished sense of self or identity that usually occurs during states of high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link]. [/p]\n\n[p] These delusions are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy doses of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelics[/int-link] and to a lesser extent [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociatives[/int-link].  \n[markdown text=\"#### Delusions of guilt\" /][i]Delusions of Guilt[/i] are caused by unfounded and intense feelings of remorse or guilt that lead the person to conclude that one must have committed some sort of deeply unethical act. The supposed unethical act can range from something relatively mild, such as the belief that the person has cheated on their partner; it can also be something much more serious, such as the belief that they have murdered their friends and family. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusions of guilt are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] compounds. [/p]\n\n[p] [markdown text=\"#### Delusions of Reified Fiction\" /][i]Delusions of reified fiction[/i] are the unfounded belief that something fictional, such as the plot of a TV show, film, video game, or book, is an actual real-life event. This delusion may manifest as the perception that the fictional events within media that is currently being consumed are genuinely occurring in one's immediate vicinity, or simply that the events in the media are real and currently occurring somewhere in the world. This delusion seems to be a result of high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/immersion-enhancement\"]immersion enhancement[/int-link] combined with [int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression\"]memory suppression[/int-link] creating a state of mind in which somebody is highly engrossed in media while no longer having a functional long-term memory that can recall the difference between reality and fiction. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusions of reified fiction are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociative[/int-link] and occasionally [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] compounds. [/p]\n\n[p] [h3] Delusional Derealization [/h3] [i]Delusional derealization[/i] is the unfounded belief that the person is currently inside of a video game, dream, or movie and therefore their current actions will not have any real-life consequences. In extreme situations and depending on the person, this delusion can sometimes result in committing crimes or violent acts. It seems to be a result of intense [int-link to=\"/effects/psychosis\"]psychosis[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/derealization\"]derealization[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/disinhibition\"]disinhibition[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression\"]memory suppression[/int-link] combining to create an altered state of mind in which somebody mistakes reality for a fictional hallucination. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusional derealization is most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogens and occasionally during stimulant psychosis. [/p]\n\n[h3] Delusions of Sobriety [/h3] \n\n[p] A [i]delusion of sobriety[/i] typically involves the falsely held belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary, such as severe cognitive impairment, significant [int-link to=\"/effects/motor-control-loss\"]motor control loss[/int-link], and an inability to fully communicate with others. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusions of sobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of GABAergic compounds such as alcohol and benzodiazepines. However, in many cases, this state of mind can stem not just from the delusional belief of one's own sobriety, but also from a sense of denial that is motivated by a need to protect one's ego, or a genuine inability to identify one's own intoxication. [/p]\n\n[h3] Delusions of Permanent Unsobriety [/h3] \n\n[p] A [i]delusion of permanent unsobriety[/i] is the belief that has permanently changed the operation of their mind and will remain in an unsober state. This can also manifest as a fear that one has broken their brain through substance abuse, despite there being no convincing evidence to substantiate such a claim. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusions of permanent unsobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociative[/int-link] and occasionally [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] compounds. [/p]\n\n[h3] Shared delusions [/h3] \n\n[p] Shared delusions are when a delusional belief is experienced in a group setting and it begins to spread between individuals who are similarly intoxicated.[ref to=\"4\" no=\"1\" /] For example, if one person makes a verbal statement regarding a delusional belief that they are currently holding while in the presence of other similarly intoxicated people, they may also begin to hold the same delusion. This can result in shared hallucinations and a general reinforcement of the level of conviction in which they are each holding the delusional belief. [/p]\n\n[p] Shared delusions are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] compounds. [/p]\n\n[h3] Delusional parasitosis [/h3] \n\n[p] [i]Delusional parasitosis[/i], also known as [i]Ekbom's syndrome[/i],[ref to=\"13\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"14\" no=\"1\" /] is a form of delusion in which victims acquire a strongly held belief that they are infested with parasites, bugs, and insects, whereas in reality, no such parasites are present.[ref to=\"15\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Sufferers may injure themselves in attempts to rid themselves of the \"parasites.\" Some are able to induce the condition in others through suggestion, in which case the term \"folie à deux\" may be applicable.[ref to=\"14\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"16\" no=\"1\" /] During this state, nearly any marking upon the skin, small object or particle found on the person or their clothing can be interpreted as evidence for the parasitic infestation. If this delusion is ongoing, sufferers may compulsively gather such \"evidence\" and then present it to medical professionals when seeking help.[ref to=\"17\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] In the context of psychoactive substances this effect is common during stimulant psychosis, often after chronic usage of cocaine or methamphetamine.[ref to=\"18\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]"

    "description_raw": "[captioned-image src=\"/img/gallery/Artistic_depiction_of_unity.png\" top=\"true\" width=\"250\" artist=\"John Archibald Wheeler\" title=\"Self Excited Circuit\" caption=\"This symbol depicts the universe as a self-excited circuit. It was originally created by the late theoretical physicist John Archibald Wheeler in his 1983 paper Law Without Law. The eye represents the self and the line directly opposite represents that which it is perceiving within the external environment. The two sections are connected into each other via arrows to demonstrate that it is a singular and unified system.\" border=\"true\" align=\"right\" /]\n\n[p][b]Unity and interconnectedness[/b] can be described as an experience where one's sense of self becomes temporarily changed to feel as if it is constituted by a wider array of concepts than it previously did. For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively their “ego” or a combination of their “ego” and physical body, this effect can cause their sense of identity to also include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. This results in intense and inextricable feelings of unity or interconnectedness between oneself and varying arrays of previously \"external\" systems.[/p]\n\n[p]It is worth noting that many people who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, the destruction of which is often described as some sort of profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.” However, it is important to understand that these conclusions and feelings should not necessarily be accepted at face value as inherently true.[/p]\n\n[p]Feelings of unity and interconnectedness most commonly occur under the influence of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] compounds, such as LSD, DMT, ayahuasca, mescaline, and ketamine. However, they can also occur during well-practiced meditation, deep states of contemplation, and intense focus.[/p]\n\n[p]There are a total of four distinct levels of identity a person can experience during this state. These various altered states of unity have been arranged into a leveling system that orders its different states from least to the most number of concepts that one's identity is currently attributed to. These levels are described below. [/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Unity between specific external systems\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]At the lowest level, this effect can be described as a perceived sense of unity between two or more systems within the external environment, which are usually perceived as separate from each other in everyday life. This is the least complex level of unity, as it is the only level of interconnectedness where the subjective experience of unity does not involve a state of interconnectedness between the self and the external.[/p]\n\n[p]There are an endless number of ways in which this level can manifest, but common examples of the experience often include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] A sense of unity between specific living things, such as animals or plants and their surrounding ecosystems. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between other human beings and the objects they are currently interacting with. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between any number of currently perceivable inanimate objects. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between humanity and nature. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between literally any combination of perceivable external systems and concepts. [/li]\n[/ul]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Unity between the self and specific external systems\" labelBackground=\"#999997\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]At this level, unity can be described as feeling as if one's identity (in addition to the body and/or brain) is attributed to specific external systems or concepts within the immediate environment, particularly those that would usually be considered as intrinsically separate from one's own being.[/p]\n\n[p]The experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the specific physical systems or concepts that are currently the subject of a person's attention within the perceivable external environment. This creates a sensation of becoming inextricably \"connected to\", \"one with\", \"the same as\", or \"unified\" with whatever the perceived external system happens to be.[/p]\n\n[p]There are an endless number of ways in which this level can manifest itself, but common examples of the experience often include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li] Becoming unified with and identifying with a specific object that one is interacting with. [/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with another person or multiple people. This is particularly common if they are engaging in sexual or romantic activities.[/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with the entirety of one's own physical body.[/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with large crowds of people. This is particularly common at raves and music festivals.[/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with the external environment, but not the people within it.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[/headered-textbox]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Unity between the self and all perceivable external systems\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]At this level, unity can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to the entirety of their immediately perceivable external environment due to a loss of perceived boundaries between the previously separate systems.[/p]\n\n[p]The effect creates a sensation that a person has become \"one with their surroundings.” This is felt to be the result of a person’s sense of self becoming attributed to the internal narrative of the ego as well as the body itself and everything physically percepted around it. It creates the compelling perspective that one is the external environment experiencing itself through a specific point within it, namely the physical sensory perceptions of the body that one's consciousness is currently residing in.[/p]\n\n[p]It is at this point that a key component of the high-level unity experience becomes an extremely noticeable factor. Once a person's sense of self has become attributed to the entirety of their surroundings, this new perspective completely changes how it feels to physically interact with what was previously felt to be an external system in one's environment. For example, when one is not in this state and is interacting with a physical object, it typically feels as though one is a central agent acting on the separate world around them. However, while undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object consistently feels as if the whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself with no central, separate agent operating the process of interaction. Instead, the process suddenly feels as if it has become completely decentralized and holistic, as the environment begins to autonomously and harmoniously respond to itself in a predetermined manner to perform the interaction carried out by the individual.[/p] [/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Unity between the self and all known external systems\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n\n[p]At the highest level, this effect can be described as feeling as if one's identity is simultaneously attributed to the entirety of the immediately perceivable external environment and all known concepts that exist outside of it. These known concepts typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe as it presently stands in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted by people as \"becoming one with the universe\".[/p]\n\n[p]When experienced, the effect creates the sudden perspective that one is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through a specific point in space and time that this particular body and conscious perception currently resides within. People who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.”[/p]\n\n[p]Although they are not necessarily literal truths about reality, many commonly reported conclusions share common themes of a religious and metaphysical nature, which are often interpreted as profound realizations. These are described and listed below:[/p]\n\n\n[ul]\n[li] The sudden and total acceptance of death as a fundamental complement of life. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of oneself, but simply the end of this specific point of a greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist and live on through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as inevitable and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment. [/li]\n[li] The subjective perspective that one's preconceived notions of \"god\" or deities are felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all possible power (omnipotence), all possible knowledge (omniscience), is self-creating and self-sustaining, then the universe and its contents could also be viewed as \"god\". [/li]\n[li] The subjective perspective that one, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all humanity's sufferings and flaws, but also includes its acts of love and achievements. [/li]\n[/ul]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[h3]Further reading[/h3]\n\n[p]Similar accounts of the experience of unity with the universe and the apparent illusory nature of the self can be found across a surprisingly large variety of independent religious, philosophical, and psychological sources. A number of these have been collected and listed as a set of documented examples below:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneness_(metaphysics)\"] Oneness [/ext-link] is a philosophical position arguing that there is only one thing which all things are not separate from and that it works together as a unified system of behaviour. [/li]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_monism\"]Dialectical monism [/ext-link] is a philosophical position arguing that the appearance of duality arises from the mind's need to impose divisions and boundaries upon an essentially unified whole. Thus, for the dialectical monist, reality is ultimately one, but can usually only be experienced in terms of division. [/li]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_feeling\"] The oceanic feeling [/ext-link] is a state within psychology which is described as a sensation of an indissoluble bond of being connected with the external world in its integral form. [/li]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism\"] Nondualism[/ext-link] is a philosophy found within many religions which states that there is no difference between the concept of the external environment and the self. [/li]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts\"] Alan Watts [/ext-link] is a philosopher who spoke extensively about the illusory nature of the self. His lectures can be found for free on the [ext-link to=\"http://www.proxybay.de/torrent/7154827/Alan_Watts-_Out_of_Your_Mind_(The_Essential_Lectures)\"] The Pirate Bay [/ext-link] and in parts within many videos across [ext-link to=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXmz605GAnc\"] YouTube [/ext-link].

It was originally created by the late theoretical physicist John Archibald Wheeler in his 1983 paper Law Without Law. The eye represents the self and the line directly opposite represents that which it is perceiving within the external environment. The two sections are connected into each other via arrows to demonstrate that it is a singular and unified system.\\\" border=\\\"true\\\" align=\\\"right\\\" /]\\n\\n[p][b]Unity and interconnectedness[/b] can be described as an experience where one's sense of self becomes temporarily changed to feel as if it is constituted by a wider array of concepts than it previously did. For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively their “ego” or a combination of their “ego” and physical body, this effect can cause their sense of identity to also include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. This results in intense and inextricable feelings of unity or interconnectedness between oneself and varying arrays of previously \\\"external\\\" systems.[/p]\\n\\n[p]It is worth noting that many people who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, the destruction of which is often described as some sort of profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.” However, it is important to understand that these conclusions and feelings should not necessarily be accepted at face value as inherently true.[/p]\\n\\n[p]Feelings of unity and interconnectedness most commonly occur under the influence of [int-link to=\\\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\\\"]psychedelic[/int-link] and [int-link to=\\\"/summaries/dissociatives\\\"]dissociative[/int-link] compounds, such as LSD, DMT, ayahuasca, mescaline, and ketamine. However, they can also occur during well-practiced meditation, deep states of contemplation, and intense focus.[/p]\\n\\n[p]There are a total of four distinct levels of identity a person can experience during this state. These various altered states of unity have been arranged into a leveling system that orders its different states from least to the most number of concepts that one's identity is currently attributed to. These levels are described below. [/p]\\n\\n[hr/]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 1\\\" header=\\\"Unity between specific external systems\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#aaaaaa\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]\\n[p]At the lowest level, this effect can be described as a perceived sense of unity between two or more systems within the external environment, which are usually perceived as separate from each other in everyday life. This is the least complex level of unity, as it is the only level of interconnectedness where the subjective experience of unity does not involve a state of interconnectedness between the self and the external.[/p]\\n\\n[p]There are an endless number of ways in which this level can manifest, but common examples of the experience often include:[/p]\\n\\n[ul]\\n  [li] A sense of unity between specific living things, such as animals or plants and their surrounding ecosystems. [/li]\\n  [li] A sense of unity between other human beings and the objects they are currently interacting with. [/li]\\n  [li] A sense of unity between any number of currently perceivable inanimate objects. [/li]\\n  [li] A sense of unity between humanity and nature. [/li]\\n  [li] A sense of unity between literally any combination of perceivable external systems and concepts. [/li]\\n[/ul]\\n[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 2\\\" header=\\\"Unity between the self and specific external systems\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#999997\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]\\n[p]At this level, unity can be described as feeling as if one's identity (in addition to the body and/or brain) is attributed to specific external systems or concepts within the immediate environment, particularly those that would usually be considered as intrinsically separate from one's own being.[/p]\\n\\n[p]The experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the specific physical systems or concepts that are currently the subject of a person's attention within the perceivable external environment. This creates a sensation of becoming inextricably \\\"connected to\\\", \\\"one with\\\", \\\"the same as\\\", or \\\"unified\\\" with whatever the perceived external system happens to be.[/p]\\n\\n[p]There are an endless number of ways in which this level can manifest itself, but common examples of the experience often include:[/p]\\n\\n[ul]\\n[li] Becoming unified with and identifying with a specific object that one is interacting with. [/li]\\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with another person or multiple people. This is particularly common if they are engaging in sexual or romantic activities.[/li]\\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with the entirety of one's own physical body.[/li]\\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with large crowds of people. This is particularly common at raves and music festivals.[/li]\\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with the external environment, but not the people within it.[/li]\\n[/ul]\\n[/headered-textbox]\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 3\\\" header=\\\"Unity between the self and all perceivable external systems\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#777776\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]\\n[p]At this level, unity can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to the entirety of their immediately perceivable external environment due to a loss of perceived boundaries between the previously separate systems.[/p]\\n\\n[p]The effect creates a sensation that a person has become \\\"one with their surroundings.” This is felt to be the result of a person’s sense of self becoming attributed to the internal narrative of the ego as well as the body itself and everything physically percepted around it. It creates the compelling perspective that one is the external environment experiencing itself through a specific point within it, namely the physical sensory perceptions of the body that one's consciousness is currently residing in.[/p]\\n\\n[p]It is at this point that a key component of the high-level unity experience becomes an extremely noticeable factor. Once a person's sense of self has become attributed to the entirety of their surroundings, this new perspective completely changes how it feels to physically interact with what was previously felt to be an external system in one's environment. For example, when one is not in this state and is interacting with a physical object, it typically feels as though one is a central agent acting on the separate world around them. However, while undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object consistently feels as if the whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself with no central, separate agent operating the process of interaction. Instead, the process suddenly feels as if it has become completely decentralized and holistic, as the environment begins to autonomously and harmoniously respond to itself in a predetermined manner to perform the interaction carried out by the individual.[/p] [/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 4\\\" header=\\\"Unity between the self and all known external systems\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#555554\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]\\n\\n[p]At the highest level, this effect can be described as feeling as if one's identity is simultaneously attributed to the entirety of the immediately perceivable external environment and all known concepts that exist outside of it. These known concepts typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe as it presently stands in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted by people as \\\"becoming one with the universe\\\".[/p]\\n\\n[p]When experienced, the effect creates the sudden perspective that one is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through a specific point in space and time that this particular body and conscious perception currently resides within. People who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.”[/p]\\n\\n[p]Although they are not necessarily literal truths about reality, many commonly reported conclusions share common themes of a religious and metaphysical nature, which are often interpreted as profound realizations. These are described and listed below:[/p]\\n\\n\\n[ul]\\n[li] The sudden and total acceptance of death as a fundamental complement of life. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of oneself, but simply the end of this specific point of a greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist and live on through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as inevitable and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment. [/li]\\n[li] The subjective perspective that one's preconceived notions of \\\"god\\\" or deities are felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all possible power (omnipotence), all possible knowledge (omniscience), is self-creating and self-sustaining, then the universe and its contents could also be viewed as \\\"god\\\". [/li]\\n[li] The subjective perspective that one, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all humanity's sufferings and flaws, but also includes its acts of love and achievements. [/li]\\n[/ul]\\n[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[h3]Further reading[/h3]\\n\\n[p]Similar accounts of the experience of unity with the universe and the apparent illusory nature of the self can be found across a surprisingly large variety of independent religious, philosophical, and psychological sources. A number of these have been collected and listed as a set of documented examples below:[/p]\\n\\n[ul]\\n\\n[li] [ext-link to=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneness_(metaphysics)\\\"] Oneness [/ext-link] is a philosophical position arguing that there is only one thing which all things are not separate from and that it works together as a unified system of behaviour. [/li]\\n\\n[li] [ext-link to=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_monism\\\"]Dialectical monism [/ext-link] is a philosophical position arguing that the appearance of duality arises from the mind's need to impose divisions and boundaries upon an essentially unified whole. Thus, for the dialectical monist, reality is ultimately one, but can usually only be experienced in terms of division. [/li]\\n\\n[li] [ext-link to=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_feeling\\\"] The oceanic feeling [/ext-link] is a state within psychology which is described as a sensation of an indissoluble bond of being connected with the external world in its integral form. [/li]\\n\\n[li] [ext-link to=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism\\\"] Nondualism[/ext-link] is a philosophy found within many religions which states that there is no difference between the concept of the external environment and the self.

I have been fascinated by this effect for around a decade now and first came to learn of its existence as a teenager through the numerous first hand accounts given to me by my close friends. This effect was further solidified in my mind as something of extreme significance after I found the works of Alan Watts through his philosophical lectures and writings. I then proceeded to dive headfirst into meditation and obsessively contemplating the supposedly illusory nature of the self on a daily basis. I even found that on more than one occasion, I could lead people into experiencing states of high level unity by simply saying the right words to them during heavy psychedelic trips.  \"]},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"However, despite my borderline obsession with this subjective effect and its associated philosophical frameworks, I found that no matter how heavy a dosage of a psychedelic I consumed, I could never experience this state of mind for myself. This led me to the conclusion that regardless of how common an occurrence this effect was for many other experienced psychedelic users, my extreme fascination with it must be the exact thing that is preventing me from experiencing it for myself. This caused me to inevitably let my guard down for what was to come. Approximately two years later while under the influence of ayahuasca, I spontaneously found myself undergoing a state of level 4 unity for the first time in my life.

These experiences seemingly came out of nowhere and I cannot for the life of me understand or figure out any causal factors or correlations behind the triggering of this state of mind.  As far as I can tell, it seems that certain individuals are much more prone to it than others, but almost everybody will inevitably experience this if they trip regularly enough over a long period of time. It does not seem to be dependent on the dosage or the psychedelic in question, although set and setting seems to be at least somewhat of a factor. Situations involving beautiful nature, deep contemplation, and philosophical conversation can often cause it to come about, but not in a reliable or reproducible fashion. It therefore seems that states of unity and interconnectedness must arise organically and out of a situation in which the person either comes to a conclusion of their own accord, or perhaps where some subconscious process of the mind is allowed to independently arise in an autonomous manner. \"]},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"At this point, I cannot deny that I personally believe the common conception of a separate self is merely a construct of human perception.

      "raw": "[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"][p]Without any question or hesitation, I undoubtedly believe that this particular transpersonal effect is by far the most important and significant state of mind the psychedelic experience has to offer. I have been fascinated by this effect for around a decade now and first came to learn of its existence as a teenager through the numerous first hand accounts given to me by my close friends. This effect was further solidified in my mind as something of extreme significance after I found the works of Alan Watts through his philosophical lectures and writings. I then proceeded to dive headfirst into meditation and obsessively contemplating the supposedly illusory nature of the self on a daily basis. I even found that on more than one occasion, I could lead people into experiencing states of high level unity by simply saying the right words to them during heavy psychedelic trips.  [/p]\n\n[p]However, despite my borderline obsession with this subjective effect and its associated philosophical frameworks, I found that no matter how heavy a dosage of a psychedelic I consumed, I could never experience this state of mind for myself. This led me to the conclusion that regardless of how common an occurrence this effect was for many other experienced psychedelic users, my extreme fascination with it must be the exact thing that is preventing me from experiencing it for myself. This caused me to inevitably let my guard down for what was to come. Approximately two years later while under the influence of ayahuasca, I spontaneously found myself undergoing a state of level 4 unity for the first time in my life. This happened on two separate occasions within a month and, at the time, were by far the most profound and lifechanging psychedelic experiences I had ever undergone in my entire life. \u000b\u000b [/p]\n\n[p]In the years after these two experiences, I have since undergone states of unity on two other occasions, both of which were under the influence of 4-HO-MET and also less than a month apart. These experiences seemingly came out of nowhere and I cannot for the life of me understand or figure out any causal factors or correlations behind the triggering of this state of mind.  As far as I can tell, it seems that certain individuals are much more prone to it than others, but almost everybody will inevitably experience this if they trip regularly enough over a long period of time. It does not seem to be dependent on the dosage or the psychedelic in question, although set and setting seems to be at least somewhat of a factor. Situations involving beautiful nature, deep contemplation, and philosophical conversation can often cause it to come about, but not in a reliable or reproducible fashion. It therefore seems that states of unity and interconnectedness must arise organically and out of a situation in which the person either comes to a conclusion of their own accord, or perhaps where some subconscious process of the mind is allowed to independently arise in an autonomous manner. [/p]\n\n[p]At this point, I cannot deny that I personally believe the common conception of a separate self is merely a construct of human perception. In fact, I would go even further and state that based upon my extensive research, this widely held position is both philosophically and scientifically justifiable. However, I want to make it clear that I do not have any desire to convince people of that here. Instead, I simply aim to document the subjective experience of this perspective in a manner that is as comprehensive and reasonable as possible. This is with the hope that people far more intelligent than me can someday use this article as a template for furthering our collective understanding of this profound and absolutely fascinating state of mind.

It is usually a direct result of [int-link to=\"/effects/dehydration\"]dehydration[/int-link] but can be felt to occur regardless of the actual dryness of a person's mouth. At extreme levels, this effect can become so strong that it becomes extremely difficult and uncomfortable to swallow.[/p]\n\n[p]Chronic xerostomia or \"dry mouth syndrome\" is the regular and/or consistent experience of having a dry mouth that can result due to natural causes or as a product of the prolonged usage of mouth-drying substances.

[/li]\n [li] Feeling cheerful, calm, active, and interested in things. [/li]\n [li] Possessing cognitive flexibility. [/li]\n [li] Sleep is refreshing or restorative. [/li]\n [li] A unifying outlook on life which guides actions and feelings to shape the future. [/li]\n [li] Being resistant to stress (resilience and anxiety or frustration tolerance). [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p] It is worth noting that this is unlikely to be an isolated effect component but rather the result of combining an appropriate environment with other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/rejuvenation\"]rejuvenation[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/introspection\"]introspection[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/personal-bias-suppression\"]personal bias suppression[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/spirituality-enhancement\"]spirituality enhancement[/int-link]. In many cases, it may also stem from the direct neurological changes that occur as a result of a substances’ pharmacological action. [/p]\n\n[p] Euthymia most commonly occurs at varying levels of efficacy under the influence of a range of different substances, primarily [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelics[/int-link] in combination with psychotherapy[ref to=\"30\" /][ref to=\"31\" /], or [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociatives[/int-link].[ref to=\"26\" /] However, it can also occur throughout the course of prescribed psychiatric medications and under the influence of certain entactogens. [/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"analysis\"]Analysis[/h2]\n\n[p] A 2021 meta analysis examined 12 double-blind randomized controlled trials for classical psychedelics treating depressive symptoms.[ref to=\"30\" /] A single-dose [i]in combination with a psychotherapy treatment program[/i] created moderate to large reductions in negative mood symptoms. This reduction remained consistent at several intervals throughout the examined time-frame of 3 hours to 60 days; there were simply not enough randomized clinical trials to extend their timeframe. This effect was present in both healthy and disordered patients. [/p]\n\n[p] A 2020 meta analysis examined 9 placebo-controlled studies for psychedelic psychotherapy.[ref to=\"31\" /] The studies had one to three doses [i]in combination with a psychotherapy treatment program[/i] and results were measured several times over the course of 6 months. The authors' effect size indicated an 80% probability that a randomly selected patient receiving psychedelic psychotherapy outperforms a patient receiving placebo. Additionally, there were no incidents of severe adverse effects. The authors even compared their results to other meta analyses examining \"gold standard\" treatments for several mental health problems: psychedelic psychotherapy greatly outperformed. [/p]\n\n[p] Psychotherapy with 1-3 doses of a classical psychedelic greatly outperforms current pharmacological standards in regards to producing a depression reduction all while having minimal to no adverse effects. The benefits of only needing a single dose over the course of 6 months as opposed to a daily administration of a substance incurring larger side effects and not producing desired effects until the 2-4 week mark appear obvious. [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"immediate-relief\"] Immediate Relief [/h3]\n\n[p] [i]Scheduling activities[/i] is a behavioral treatment for depression that appears as effective as other psychological or pharmacological treatments.[ref to=\"10\" /] There is a significant relationship between mood and the number of pleasant activities engaged in. Depressed individuals find fewer activities pleasant, engage in pleasant activities less frequently, and obtain less positive reinforcement. [/p]\n\n[p] [i]Exercise[/i] is an evidence-based treatment for depression.[ref to=\"11\" /][ref to=\"12\" /][ref to=\"13\" /][ref to=\"14\" /][ref to=\"23\" /] It also has the advantage of preventing the increased risk of drug-drug interactions. Moderate to heavy exercise of any type (including yoga) appears as effective, and do not significantly differ from, other pure forms of depression treatment such as psychotherapy or pharmacological treatment. Large changes in fitness do not appear necessary either. [/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"ketamine-and-its-isomers\"]Ketamine and its isomers[/h2]\n\n[p][i] WARNING [/i] [ref to=\"27\" /][ref to=\"28\" /]- Ketamine possesses a strong abuse potential at typical antidepressive doses. Ketamine has reported cases of severe bladder and liver injury. Esketamine, a newer nasal spray formulation of Ketamine, does not have any reported cases and is purported to have a better safety profile. However, in recent short-term clinical trials esketamine still more-than-doubled the amount of adverse bladder events when compared to placebo (6-10% vs 1-4%).  Although 2/3 of esketamine incidents resolved themselves either without intervention or through a lowering of dosage, any physiological damage is acute and immediate: in typical dose regimens steady-state concentrations are not reached. [/p]\n\n[p]Ketamine offers a (dose-dependent) large immediate depression reduction for 30-50% of patients; its effect-sizes become moderate to small by day 7.[ref to=\"24\" /][ref to=\"25\" /][ref to=\"29\" /] Weekly to biweekly dosing maintains a statistically significant depression reduction measured at Day 28 and repeated administration has resulted in cases of euthymia.[ref to=\"26\" /][ref to=\"28\" /] A family history of alcohol-use-disorder in a first-degree relative is associated with an improved antidepressive response, and a reduction of adverse mental effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-dysphoria\"]dysphoria[/int-link]. Its antidepressant properties may also stem more generally from dissociatives' [int-link to=\"/effects/novelty-enhancement\"]novelty[/int-link] and/or [int-link to=\"/effects/immersion-enhancement\"]immersion enhancements[/int-link]. [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"ketamine-long-term\"] Long-term [/h3]\n\n[p]There is no doubt Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is an effective treatment for adult depression.[ref to=\"15\" /] There are no large differences in efficacy between major psychotherapies for mild to moderate depression.[ref to=\"16\" /] There is also a large body of evidence supporting computerized care, and psychoeducational interventions.[ref to=\"17\" /][ref to=\"18\" /][ref to=\"19\" /][ref to=\"20\" /][ref to=\"21\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] For patients with mild or moderate depression in natural settings, antidepressant relapse rate is high. Behavioral therapy may prevent relapses in the long-term.[ref to=\"22\" /] [/p]\n\n"

For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively their “ego” or a combination of their “ego” and physical body, during this state their sense of identity can change to include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. Alternatively, a person could feel as if their sense of self embodies nothing at all, which is an experience commonly referred to as ##int-link|to=\"/effects/depersonalization\"{depersonalization}.\n\nThere are a total of 5 distinct levels of identity which a person can experience. These various altered states of identity have been arranged into a levelling system that orders its different states from least to the most number of concepts one's identity is currently attributed to. These levels are described and documented below:\n##md{### 1. Total absence of attributed identity (depersonalization)}The lowest level of identity can be described as the sensation that there is a complete absence of having any sense of self at all. This is referred to in psychiatry as \"##int-link|to=\"/effects/depersonalization\"{depersonalization}\". It can be described as an anomaly of self-awareness that consists of a feeling of watching oneself act as one normally would, while also feeling is if they have no control over the situation. During this state, the affected person may feel that they are \"on autopilot\" and that the world has become vague, dreamlike, less real, or lacking in significance. Individuals who experience depersonalization often feel divorced from their own personal physicality by no longer sensing their body sensations, feelings, emotions, and behaviours as belonging to a person or identity. It is also often claimed by people who have depersonalization that reality seems unreal, distant or hazy. \n\nDepersonalization can sometimes be distressing to the user, who may become disoriented by the loss of a sense that their self is the origin of their thoughts and actions. However, it does not have to be an inherently negative altered state of awareness, as it does not directly affect one's emotions or thought patterns.\n\nIt is perfectly normal for many people to slip into this state temporarily, often without even realizing it. For example, many people often note that they enter a detached state of autopilot during stressful situations or when performing monotonous routine tasks such as driving.\n\nWithin the context of identity-altering effects, depersonalization can be considered as being at the opposite end of the identity spectrum relative to states of ##int-link|to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"{unity and interconnectedness}. This is because, during depersonalization, a person senses and attributes their identity to nothing, giving a sense of having no self. However, during a state of unity and interconnectedness, one senses and attributes their identity to everything, giving a sense that the entirety of existence is their self.\n\nDepersonalization is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as anxiety and a very similar psychological disorder known as derealization. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of ##int-link|to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"{dissociative} compounds, such as ketamine, PCP, and ##int-link|to=\"/substances/dxm/\"{DXM}. However, it can also occur to a lesser extent during the withdrawal symptoms of stimulants and depressants.\n##md{### 2. Self-contained separate identity}The second level of identity can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to their brain and/or body. This is often said to feel as if one is a consciousness, the guiding force located within a body which is immersed in and interacting with a distinctly separate external environment. It is usually accompanied with a sense of free will or agency over all the thoughts and actions the person makes, which results in them feeling as if their decision-making processes are arising from an internal source which is not necessarily determined by cause and effect in the same manner as external systems.\n\nA self-contained separate identity is by far the most common form of identity. Mainstream Western cultural notions consider this conception of identity to be the self-evident and logical way to perceive the world as well as the only form of identity which isn't intrinsically delusional. Despite being culturally normative, this belief has received considerable debate and criticism within modern neuroscience and philosophy.\n\nAlthough drastically altered in comparison to that of sobriety, it is also worth noting that hallucinatory states such as ego replacement and 2nd person ##int-link|to=\"/effects/perspective-hallucination\"{perspective hallucinations} typically still fall under the classification of this level. In both cases, a person still feels as if they are a separate agent facing the external world, but have the perception of being a different identity than their sober self.\n##md{### 3. Identifying with specific \"external\" systems}The third level of identity alteration can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to (in addition to the body and/or brain) specific external systems or concepts within the immediate environment, particularly those that would usually be considered as intrinsically separate from one's own being.\n\nThe experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the specific physical systems or concepts within the perceivable external environment which are currently the subjects of their thoughts or focus. This creates a sensation of becoming inextricably \"connected to\", \"one with\", \"the same as\", or \"unified\" with whatever the perceived external system happens to be.\n\nThere are an endless number of ways in which this level manifests itself, but common examples of the experience often include:\n\n##md{- Becoming unified with and identifying with a specific object one is interacting with.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with another person or multiple people, particularly common if engaging in sexual or romantic activities.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with the entirety of one's own physical body.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with large crowds of people, particularly common at raves and music festivals.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with the external environment, but not the people within it.}\nThis level of identity alteration most commonly occurs during intense states of focus, meditation, or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.\n##md{### 4. Identifying with all perceivable \"external\" systems}The fourth level of identity alteration can be defined as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to the entirety of their immediately perceivable external environment.\n\nThe experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the entirety of their sensory input or the currently perceivable external environment. It creates a sensation in the person that they have “become one with their surroundings.” This is felt to be the result of a person’s sense of self becoming attributed to not just primarily the internal narrative of the ego, but in equal measure to the body itself and everything around it which it is physically perceiving through the senses. This sensation creates the compelling perspective that the person is the external environment experiencing itself through a specific point within it, namely the physical sensory perceptions of the body their consciousness currently resides in.\n\nIt is at this point that a key component of the high-level identity alteration experience becomes an extremely noticeable factor. Once a person's sense of self has become attributed to the entirety of their surroundings, this new perspective completely changes how it feels to physically interact with what was previously felt to be an external environment. For example, when a person is not in this state and is interacting with a physical object, it typically feels as though they are a central agent acting on the separate world around them.\n\nHowever, while undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object consistently feels as if the whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself with no central, separate agent operating the process of interaction. Instead, the process suddenly feels as if it has become completely decentralized and holistic, as the environment begins to autonomously and harmoniously respond to itself in a predetermined manner to perform the interaction carried out by the individual.\n\nThis level of identity alteration most commonly occurs during intense states of focus, meditation, or under the influence of hallucinogens such as ##int-link|to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"{psychedelics}.\n##md{### 5. Identifying with all known \"external\" systems}##cap-img|src=\"/img/gallery/Artistic_depiction_of_unity.png\"|top=\"true\"|border=\"true\"|width=\"250\"|artist=\"John Archibald Wheeler\"|title=\"Self Excited Circuit\"|caption=\"This symbol depicts the universe as a self-excited circuit.

These known concepts typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe as it presently stands in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted by people as becoming one with the universe.\n\nWhen experienced, the effect creates the sudden perspective that the person is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through the specific point in space and time which this particular body and conscious perception happens to currently reside within. People who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of supposedly profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.”\n\nAlthough they are not necessarily literal truths about reality, at this point, many commonly reported conclusions of a religious and metaphysical nature often begin to manifest themselves as profound realizations. These are described below:\n\n##md{- The sudden and total acceptance of death as a fundamental complement of life. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of a person, but simply the end of this specific point of a greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist and live on through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as an inevitable, and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment, but simply a fact of reality.\n- The subjective perspective that the person's preconceived notions of \"god\" or deities can be felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all possible power (omnipotence), all possible knowledge (omniscience), is self-creating, and self-sustaining then on either a semantic or literal level the universe and its contents could also be viewed as god.\n- The subjective perspective that the person, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all of humanity's sufferings and flaws but also includes its acts of love and achievements.}\nThis state most commonly occurs during intense states of well-practiced meditation or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.\n##md{#### Further reading}Similar accounts of the experience of unity with the universe and the apparent illusory nature of the self can be found across a surprisingly large variety of independent religious, philosophical, and psychological sources.

Together, these individual geometric representations are perceived to simultaneously convey every internally stored concept and memory contained within the mind.[/p]\n\n[p]At its lower end, this effect is something that fluctuates wildly and is neither constant or consistent in its intensity. Instead, it is momentarily triggered by the experience of a concept. For example, if someone were to say the word \"Internet\" to a person who is currently undergoing this state, they would see the mind's concept of the Internet immediately manifested in a geometric form amidst the very centre of their visual field. This form will then quickly branch out from itself in a manner similar to a spider diagram or mind map chart.[/p]\n\n[p]For example, the concept \"Internet\" may have dozens of immediate child nodes that are representative of computers, which may have associated descendant nodes involving technologies. This may branch out further to include concepts representing human intelligence, which may then branch out into concepts related to the evolution of humanity, and so on until all concepts known to the person are represented within the network.[/p]\n\n[p]Once this occurs, the [int-link to=\"/effects/sensory-overload\"]sensory overload[/int-link] can temporarily disconnect one from their external environment and result in simultaneous long-term [int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression\"]memory suppression[/int-link], or \"[int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression?s=ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link]\",  for several seconds to a minute before a person is briefly returned to reality. This is usually triggered again and again in quick succession. However, it is worth noting that this process can, to a certain extent, be disabled through continuous physical movements. This may be because movement stops the process of thoughts branching out by not giving one's brain the time it needs to lock onto new concepts as it is focused on movement rather than processing thoughts.[/p]\n\n[p]As the dose of the psychoactive substance is increased, the process becomes easier to trigger while extending its length and duration. This eventually results in a stable state of complete disconnection from the external environment alongside sustained \"ego death\", as well as feelings of experiencing \"all of existence\" in a single instant.[/p]\n\n[p]Visual exposure to inner mechanics of consciousness is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression?s=ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link] and high level [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link].

    "description_raw": "[p][b]Ego death[/b] (also known as [b]ego suppression[/b], [b]ego loss[/b] or [b]ego dissolution[/b]) is the temporary experience of a partial to complete disruption of a person's sense of self, which often results in a range of profound changes to how the person perceives and interprets their otherwise usually stable sense of identity, agency, and self-hood.[ref to=\"1\" /][ref to=\"2\" /][ref to=\"3\" /][ref to=\"4\" /][ref to=\"5\" /][/p]\n\n[p]These changes can include but are not limited to any combination of the following three subcategories:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Type 1\" header=\"Absent selfhood\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]An [b]absent selfhood[/b] can be described as a sudden and complete lack of the subjective experience of one's own sense of identity. During this form of ego death, there is a profound experience of remaining fully conscious, while there is no longer an “I” experiencing one's sensory input; there is just the sensory input as it is and by itself, without a conscious agent to comment on or think about what is happening to it.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Type 2\" header=\"Objectified selfhood\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]An [b]objective selfhood[/b] can be described as the experience of the person remaining aware of the existence of oneself, while no longer perceiving themselves as integrally attached to their sense of identity. Instead of feeling that they and their sense of selfhood are a unified whole which is the subject of experience, their awareness instead feels entirely separate from it's own sense of self, as if this selfhood is now the object of experience instead of the subject.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Type 3\" header=\"Expanded selfhood\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]An [b]expanded selfhood[/b] can be described as the experience of one's sense of identity becoming constituted by a wider array of concepts than it previously did. For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively their “ego” and physical body, this effect can cause their sense of identity to also include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. This results in intense and inextricable feelings of unity or interconnectedness between oneself and varying arrays of previously \"external\" systems. For more information on this experience, please see our comprehensive article on states of [int-link to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"]Unity and Interconnectedness[/int-link][/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]Ego death is well known for the transformative and significant impacts it can often have on a person's perception of both themselves and the world around them. These responses and alterations can occur both during the experience of ego death, but also in the hours, days, or weeks afterwards. [/p]\n\n[p]A few of the most common examples of this phenomenon are described and listed below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox header=\"Rejuvenation\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][int-link to=\"/effects/rejuvenation\"]Rejuvenation[/int-link] is a feeling of mild to extreme cognitive refreshment which is usually felt once the experience of ego death is over and the person has also fully recovered from the trip as a whole. The symptoms of rejuvenation often include a sustained sense of heightened mental clarity, increased emotional stability, increased calmness, mindfulness, increased motivation, personal bias suppression, increased focus, and decreased depression.

Instead of feeling that they are a unified whole with their sense of self, their awareness feels entirely separate from it's own identity, as if this selfhood is now the object of experience instead of the subject.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"type-3\" label=\"Type 3\" header=\"Expanded selfhood\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]An [i]expanded selfhood[/i] can be described as one's sense of identity becoming coming to include a wider array of concepts than it previously did. For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively constituted by their ego and physical body, this effect can cause their sense of identity to also include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. This results in intense and inextricable feelings of unity or interconnectedness between the self and varying arrays of previously \"external\" systems.[/p]\n\n[p]For more information on this experience, please see our comprehensive article on states of [int-link to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"]Unity and Interconnectedness[/int-link].[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"fear of losing control\"]Fear of losing control[/h2]\n\n[p][i]Fear of losing control[/i] is a very common occurrence when a person who undergoes ego death is not emotionally prepared, not in an appropriate set or setting, or is simply unwilling to relinquish their sense of selfhood. During this experience, the person will often find themselves experiencing overwhelming fear and anxiety relating to the fear of losing control. This fear and anxiety is especially common in those who have not experienced ego death before. [/p]\n\n[p]To overcome this fear, it is recommended that the person does their best to stop fighting the loss of control, and simply surrender themselves to the experience of ego death. Upon successfully relaxing into ego death, the person will often experience a radical and positive change in their emotional state.[/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"transformative-aspects\"]Transformative aspects[/h2]\n\n[p]Ego death is well known for the transformative and significant impacts it can have on a person's perception of both themselves and the world around them. These responses and alterations can occur during the experience of ego death, but also in the hours, days, or weeks afterwards. [/p]\n\n[p]A few of the most common examples of this phenomenon are described and listed below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"rejuvenation\" header=\"Rejuvenation\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i][int-link to=\"/effects/rejuvenation\"]Rejuvenation[/int-link][/i] is a feeling of mild to extreme cognitive refreshment which is usually felt once the experience of ego death is over and the person has fully recovered from the trip as a whole. The characteristics of rejuvenation often include a sustained sense of heightened mental clarity, personal bias suppression, and increased emotional stability, calmness, mindfulness, motivation, wellbeing, and focus. At its highest level, feelings of rejuvenation can become so intense that they manifest as the profound and overwhelming sensation of being \"reborn.\" Within the context of ego death, rejuvenation often feels as if it has occurred in a manner akin to rebooting a computer.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"personal-bias-suppression\" header=\"Personal Bias Suppression\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p][i][int-link to=\"/effects/personal-bias-suppression\"]Personal bias suppression[/int-link][/i] is a decrease in the personal or cultural biases, preferences, and associations a person knowingly or unknowingly uses to filter and interpret their perception of the world. Within the context of ego death, personal bias suppression seemingly occurs because the prior associations the ego used to contextualize phenomena have been reset to a raw state. This often results in the feeling of processing concepts from a neutral perspective completely untainted by past memories, prior experiences, and stereotypes.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"overcoming-fear-of-death\" header=\"Overcoming fear of death\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p][i]Overcoming the fear of death[/i] is very commonly associated with ego death. Those who have undergone ego death often report that they not only \"[i]experienced what it is like to die[/i]\", but also became both accustomed to and substantially less afraid of the prospect. Letting go during ego death and willfully surrendering one's own sense of self is often likened to preconceived notions about what it is like to die, which may cause this effect.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"viewing-the-self-as-an-illusory-construct\" header=\"Viewing the self as an illusory construct\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]Viewing the self as an illusory construct[/i] commonly results from the way undergoing the ego-death experience provokes a radical reframing of the nature of the self. This new perspective may take a number of forms. For example, in the case of [i]absent[/i] and [i]objectified self-hood[/i], one may conclude that the ego is not an essential component of who they are, but is instead a construct of the mind, conditioned by one's history and particular circumstances. [/p]\n\n[p]In the case of [i]expanded self-hood,[/i] where the experienced boundary between oneself and the external world is absent, it is common to become convinced that no such boundary ever actually existed. One may then believe that they are identical in nature to the universe as a unified whole, experiencing itself and expressing itself through a particular mind and body.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"increased-openness-to-experience\" header=\"Increased openness to experience\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]Increased openness to experience[/i] is a  shift in personality that is commonly reported after the experience of ego death. This change may occur as a result of feeling less obliged to conform to a particular identity and thus becoming more likely to engage in novel experiences.[/p]\n\n[p]Alternatively, those who have undergone [i]personal bias suppression[/i] will also often find themselves more open to experiences that they may have previously disregarded because they are able to reassess their interest with a fresh perspective.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"subjective-differences-between-various-substances\"] Subjective differences between various substances [/h2]\n\n[p]Within the context of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] use, ego death is most commonly triggered at heavy doses by states of high level [int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression\"]memory suppression[/int-link] which causes the person to forget who they are. At other times it can be triggered by or in combination with [int-link to=\"/effects/sensory-overload\"]sensory overload[/int-link] consuming the person's consciousness with information and overwhelming their sense of self.[/p]\n\n[p]Within the context of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] use, ego death seems to be triggered at heavy doses by increasingly intense [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-disconnection\"]cognitive disconnection[/int-link] causing a person to become dissociated from cognitive functions such as the maintenance of a sense of identity.[/p]\n\n[p]Psychedelic ego death usually occurs alongside states of level 6-7 [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] of an intense and often overwhelming nature. It may synergize with other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/personal-bias-suppression\"]personal bias suppression[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"]unity and interconnectedness[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/spirituality-enhancement\"]spirituality enhancement[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link]. These accompanying effects further elevate the subjective intensity and transpersonal significance of ego death experiences.[/p]\n\n[p]Dissociative ego death usually occurs alongside high level [int-link to=\"/categories/disconnective-effects\"]sensory disconnection[/int-link] and out of body experiences which may take place within [int-link to=\"/categories//effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]voids or holes[/int-link] filled with [int-link to=\"/categories//effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures\"]hallucinatory structures[/int-link]. Dissociative ego death is less likely to cause an anxious response for those who are inexperienced compared to psychedelic ego death. This is because many people experience dissociatives as inherently calming and tranquil while high doses of psychedelics are quite often experienced as the opposite.[/p]\n\n[p]Outside of psychedelics and dissociatives, it is also possible to experience ego death under the influence of a few other classes of psychoactive compounds. For example, extremely heavy doses of [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants\"]deliriants[/int-link] such as DPH or datura can result in ego death that is accompanied by [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/psychosis\"]psychosis[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link]. Heavy doses of salvia divinorum are extremely effective at inducing ego death that is accompanied by bizarre [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entity contact[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/machinescapes\"]machinescapes[/int-link]. Although these two classes of hallucinogens function very differently on both a subjective and neuropharmacological level, both of their variations on ego death feel as if they stem from a break down or deterioration in the brain's ability to maintain normal levels of cognitive functioning.[/p]"

This effect usually occurs at the onset of the experience and dissipates as the peak takes its toll.[/p]\n\n[p]In the context of substance usage, nausea and vomiting can occur as a result of stomach irritation through the consumption of materials which it is not used to digesting. These materials can include things such as chemical powders or plant matter. Alternatively, nausea may occur as a direct pharmacological result of how the particular substance affects the brain.

In this video I am going to comprehensively discuss, describe, and document the specific visual subjective effect which is known as ##i{psychedelic geometry}. \n\nThis will be in accordance with the terminology laid out within our comprehensive Subjective Effect Index and will be done without resorting to metaphors, analogies, or personal trip reports. To give you a better sense of the experience, I've also done my best to accompany each aspect of these descriptions with as many relevant examples of pre-existing replications and visionary artwork from across the internet as possible. \n\nAs for the effect itself, Psychedelic Geometry is defined as the experience of a person's field of vision becoming partially or completely encompassed by ever-shifting, colourful, and incomprehensibly complex geometric patterns, form constants, phosphenes, shapes, fractals, and colours. This effect is extremely common at moderate to heavy dosages of almost any psychedelic compound. And It's also this particular effect that has likely had the biggest influence on the aesthetics which we have come to associate with psychedelic and visionary artwork.\n\nGeometry is rarely motionless and is generally continuously moving and constantly self-changing in its shape and style. During this process, the geometry naturally drifts across the visual field while fluidly transitioning through many distinct states and forms.\n\nIn terms of its complexity and vividness, this effect is capable of manifesting itself across seven approximate  levels of increasing intensity. These levels of intensity primarily increase in a manner which is proportional to the dosage of the substance consumed, but can also be impacted by a wide variety of external factors such as a person's set and setting. \n\n##headered-textbox|label=\"Level 1\"|header=\"Visual Noise\"|labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\"|headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"{At the lowest and least interesting level of intensity, geometry is at it's baseline complexity and has not yet taken form.

So I think it's worth noting that while they definitely get very close, there is actually not a single replication or example of visionary artwork shown in this video that quite fully captures the true complexity of psychedelic geometry. I used to think that doing so was simply an impossible goal, but at this point I'm certain that it could be done with todays technology using high budget 3D modelling.\n\nWhile there are definitely examples of traditional visionary artwork such as these ones which do genuinely capture the essence of at least one single frame of psychedelic geometry, when it comes to animating the continuously moving and shapeshifting manner in which geometry manifests, i think it's going to take a very deliberate and concerted effort from within the replication community to truly get there.\n\nOn an entirely different note, this effect was probably the one particular aspect of the psychedelic experience that most quickly convinced me that these substances are incredibly profound and essential tools for humanity. Almost a decade ago as a young 17-year-old undergoing my first couple of hallucinogenic experiences, I found myself immediately fascinated by the sheer incomprehensibility of the beautiful patterns which my mind was producing. \n\nSince then and based on countless personal experiences, I have come to the conclusion that this effect is not simply another form of hallucination, but instead a result of neurological signals and processes from various regions of the brain bleeding into the visual cortex and being reinterpreted as complex geometric forms in a manner which is comparable to that of synaesthesia. I obviously cannot tout this assertion as fact or anything, but to me this would explain multiple aspects of geometries behaviour, such as the way in which geometry commonly feels as if it is an innately understandable visual representation of one's emotional state, sensory input, and even complex concepts or thoughts.
