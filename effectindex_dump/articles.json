      "raw": "[p]Hey there! In this video I'm going to describe and discuss the effects of Ego Death from the Subjective Effect Index. This is an incredibly profound and transformative experience that most commonly occurs under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link], dysdelic, and deliriant compounds.[/p] \n\n[p]The concept of \"ego death\" has developed along a number of related schools of thought that are as varied as, romantic movements, theosophy, anthropological research on rites de passage and shamanism, Joseph Campbell's comparative mythology, Jungian psychology, and transpersonal psychology. However, within this video I am going to be focusing solely on the modern conception of egodeath as recognised within the psychedelic and psychonautic subculture.[/p]\n\n[p]Within the subjective effect index, I’ve put a lot of effort into formalizing terminology for discussing these kinds of effects without resorting to metaphors or analogies that are common in personal trip reports, so let's get right into it. [b]Ego death[/b] (also known as [b]ego suppression[/b], [b]ego loss[/b] or [b]ego dissolution[/b]) is the temporary experience of a partial or complete disruption of a person's sense of self, which often results in a range of profound changes to how the person perceives and interprets their own sense of identity and the nature of agency and self-hood.[ref to=\"1\" /][ref to=\"2\" /][ref to=\"3\" /][ref to=\"4\" /][ref to=\"5\" /][/p]\n\n[toc/]\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"ego-death-subcategories\"]Ego Death Subcategories[/h2]\n[p]Within the psychedelic community, the term ego death colloquially applies to a number of somewhat similar experiences which I have divided into the following 3 subcategories.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"type-1\" label=\"Type 1\" header=\"Absent selfhood\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]An [i]absent selfhood[/i] can be described as a complete lack of the subjective experience of one's own sense of identity. During this form of ego death, there is a profound experience of no longer having an “I” experiencing one's sensory input; there is just awareness of sensory input as it is and by itself without a conscious agent to comment on or think about what is happening to it.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"type-2\" label=\"Type 2\" header=\"Objectified selfhood\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]An [i]objectified selfhood[/i] can be described as a person remaining aware of the existence of their self, but they no longer feel integrally attached to their identity. Instead of feeling that they are a unified whole with their sense of self, their awareness feels entirely separate from it's own identity, as if this selfhood is now the object of experience instead of the subject.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"type-3\" label=\"Type 3\" header=\"Expanded selfhood\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]An [i]expanded selfhood[/i] can be described as one's sense of identity becoming coming to include a wider array of concepts than it previously did. For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively constituted by their ego and physical body, this effect can cause their sense of identity to also include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. This results in intense and inextricable feelings of unity or interconnectedness between the self and varying arrays of previously \"external\" systems.[/p]\n\n[p]For more information on this particular experience, please see my recent extremely detailed 20 minute video on states of [int-link to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"]Unity and Interconnectedness[/int-link].[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"fear of losing control\"]Fear of losing control[/h2]\n\n[p][i]Fear of losing control[/i] is a very common occurrence when a person who undergoes ego death is not emotionally prepared, not in an appropriate set or setting, or is simply unwilling to relinquish their sense of selfhood. During this experience, the person will often find themselves experiencing overwhelming fear and anxiety relating to the fear of losing control. This fear and anxiety is especially common in those who have not experienced ego death before. [/p]\n\n[p]To overcome this fear, it is recommended that the person does their best to stop fighting the loss of control, and simply surrender themselves to the experience of ego death. Upon successfully relaxing into ego death, the person will often experience a radical and positive change in their emotional state.[/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"transformative-aspects\"]Transformative aspects[/h2]\n\n[p]Ego death is well known for the transformative and significant impacts it can have on a person's perception of both themselves and the world around them. These responses and alterations can occur during the experience of ego death, but also in the hours, days, or weeks afterwards. [/p]\n\n[p]I'll do my best to categorise and describe the most common examples of this phenomena here.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"rejuvenation\" header=\"Rejuvenation\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i][int-link to=\"/effects/rejuvenation\"]Rejuvenation[/int-link][/i] is a feeling of mild to extreme cognitive refreshment which is usually felt once the experience of ego death is over and the person has fully recovered from the trip as a whole. The characteristics of rejuvenation often include a sustained sense of heightened mental clarity, personal bias suppression, and increased emotional stability, calmness, mindfulness, motivation, wellbeing, and focus. At its highest level, feelings of rejuvenation can become so intense that they manifest as the profound and overwhelming sensation of being \"reborn.\" Within the context of ego death, rejuvenation often feels as if it has occurred in a manner akin to rebooting a computer.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"personal-bias-suppression\" header=\"Personal Bias Suppression\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p][i][int-link to=\"/effects/personal-bias-suppression\"]Personal bias suppression[/int-link][/i] is a decrease in the personal or cultural biases, preferences, and associations a person knowingly or unknowingly uses to filter and interpret their perception of the world. Within the context of ego death, personal bias suppression seemingly occurs because the prior associations the ego used to contextualize phenomena have been reset to a raw state. This often results in the feeling of processing concepts from a neutral perspective completely untainted by past memories, prior experiences, and stereotypes.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"overcoming-fear-of-death\" header=\"Overcoming fear of death\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p][i]Overcoming the fear of death[/i] is very commonly associated with ego death. Those who have undergone ego death often report that they not only \"[i]experienced what it is like to die[/i]\", but also became both accustomed to and substantially less afraid of the prospect. Letting go during ego death and willfully surrendering one's own sense of self is often likened to preconceived notions about what it is like to die, which may cause this effect.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"viewing-the-self-as-an-illusory-construct\" header=\"Viewing the self as an illusory construct\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]Viewing the self as an illusory construct[/i] commonly results from the way undergoing the ego-death experience provokes a radical reframing of the nature of the self. This new perspective may take a number of forms. For example, in the case of [i]absent[/i] and [i]objectified self-hood[/i], one may conclude that the ego is not an essential component of who they are, but is instead a construct of the mind, conditioned by one's history and particular circumstances. [/p]\n\n[p]In the case of [i]expanded self-hood,[/i] where the experienced boundary between oneself and the external world is absent, it is common to become convinced that no such boundary ever actually existed. One may then believe that they are identical in nature to the universe as a unified whole, experiencing itself and expressing itself through a particular mind and body.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"increased-openness-to-experience\" header=\"Increased openness to experience\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]Increased openness to experience[/i] is a  shift in personality that is commonly reported after the experience of ego death. This change may occur as a result of feeling less obliged to conform to a particular identity and thus becoming more likely to engage in novel experiences.[/p]\n\n[p]Alternatively, those who have undergone [i]personal bias suppression[/i] will also often find themselves more open to experiences that they may have previously disregarded because they are able to reassess their interest with a fresh perspective.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"subjective-differences-between-various-substances\"] Subjective differences between various substances [/h2]\n\n[p]Within the context of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] use, ego death is most commonly triggered at heavy doses by states of high level [int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression\"]memory suppression[/int-link] which causes the person to forget who they are. At other times it can be triggered by or in combination with [int-link to=\"/effects/sensory-overload\"]sensory overload[/int-link] consuming the person's consciousness with information and overwhelming their sense of self.[/p]\n\n[p]Within the context of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] use, ego death seems to be triggered at heavy doses by increasingly intense [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-disconnection\"]cognitive disconnection[/int-link] causing a person to become dissociated from cognitive functions such as the maintenance of a sense of identity.[/p]\n\n[p]Psychedelic ego death usually occurs alongside states of level 6-7 [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] of an intense and often overwhelming nature. It may synergize with other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/personal-bias-suppression\"]personal bias suppression[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"]unity and interconnectedness[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/spirituality-enhancement\"]spirituality enhancement[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link]. These accompanying effects further elevate the subjective intensity and transpersonal significance of ego death experiences.[/p]\n\n[p]Dissociative ego death usually occurs alongside high level [int-link to=\"/categories/disconnective-effects\"]sensory disconnection[/int-link] and out of body experiences which may take place within [int-link to=\"/categories//effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]voids or holes[/int-link] filled with [int-link to=\"/categories//effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures\"]hallucinatory structures[/int-link]. Dissociative ego death is less likely to cause an anxious response for those who are inexperienced compared to psychedelic ego death. This is because many people experience dissociatives as inherently calming and tranquil while high doses of psychedelics are quite often experienced as the opposite.[/p]\n\n[p]Outside of psychedelics and dissociatives, it is also possible to experience ego death under the influence of a few other classes of psychoactive compounds. For example, extremely heavy doses of [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants\"]deliriants[/int-link] such as DPH or datura can result in ego death that is accompanied by [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/psychosis\"]psychosis[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link]. Heavy doses of salvia divinorum are extremely effective at inducing ego death that is accompanied by bizarre [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entity contact[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/machinescapes\"]machinescapes[/int-link]. Although these two classes of hallucinogens function very differently on both a subjective and neuropharmacological level, both of their variations on ego death feel as if they stem from a break down or deterioration in the brain's ability to maintain normal levels of cognitive functioning.[/p]\n[hr/]\n[h3 id=\"similar concepts\"]Original usage and Academic Definitions[/h3]\n[p]Throughout history there have been similar concepts that were not specifically called 'ego death,' but can be seen as antecedents. These include, but are not limited to, a wide array of religious and philosophical concepts such as Anatta[ref to=\"6\" /], Satori[ref to=\"7\" /], and Jhana[ref to=\"8\" /] in Vedanta and Zen Buddhism, and Fana in Sufi Islam[ref to=\"9\" /].[/p]\n\n[p]Now as for the first identified literary use of the term 'ego death' or 'ego loss' that is in line with the contemporary concept, this seems to be contained within the 1964 book titled '[i]The Psychedelic Experience - A manual based on the tibetan book of the dead[/i]' by Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner, & Richard Alpert[ref to=\"11\" /]. In it, Leary describes ego death as a product of the \"[i]complete transcendence − beyond words, beyond space−time, beyond self[/i]\" experienced during the peak of the psychedelic experience. [/p]\n\n[p]There are too many specific examples for me to possibly list within this video, but since the publication of this book, ego death has been defined by academics and scholars within the broader literature in a variety of similar ways.[/p]\n\n[ul]\n\n[li] For instance, In 1964 Randolf Alnaes published \"Therapeutic applications of the change in consciousness produced by psycholytica\" in which he defines ego death as a \"Loss of ego-feeling.\"[ref to=\"12\" /] [/li]\n\n[li] In 1988, Stanislav Grof defined ego death as \"a sense of total annihilation... This experience of \"ego death\" seems to entail an instant merciless destruction of all previous reference points in the life of the individual... Ego death means an irreversible end to one's philosophical identification with what Alan Watts called \"skin-encapsulated ego.\"[ref to=\"13\" /] [/li]\n\n[li] In 2001 Carter Phipps defined ego death as \"the renunciation, rejection and, ultimately, the death of the need to hold on to a separate, self-centered existence.\" [ref to=\"14\" /] [/li]\n\n[li] In 2007 religious studies scholar Daniel Merkur defined ego death as \"an imageless experience in which there is no sense of personal identity. It is the experience that remains possible in a state of extremely deep trance when the ego-functions of reality-testing, sense-perception, memory, reason, fantasy and self-representation are repressed.\"[ref to=\"15\" /] [/li]\n\n[li] In 2008, Johnson, Richards & Griffiths paraphrased Leary and Grof by defining ego death as \"temporarily experiencing a complete loss of subjective self-identity.\"[ref to=\"16\" /] [/li]\n\n[li] In 2010, the psychologist John Harrison defined ego death as a \"Temporary ego death as the loss of the separate self, or, in the affirmative, a deep and profound merging with the transcendent other.\" [ref to=\"17\" /] [/li]\n\n[li]In 2016, The Ego-Dissolution Inventory was developed as a validated self-report questionnaire that allows for the measurement of ego death experiences. It defines ego dissolution as \"The experience of a compromised sense of self\".[ref to=\"18\" /] [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[h3 id=\"Neuroscientific speculation\"]Neuroscientific speculation[/h3]\n[p]In terms of the precise neurological mechanisms behind this experience, there is an increasing amount of speculation within psychedelic communities which posits that the triggering of ego death is tied into the way psychedelic substances disrupt the Default Mode Network (DMN)[ref to=\"19\" /], the large-scale brain network best known for being active when a person is awake but not focused on the outside world, such as during daydreaming and mind-wandering.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of scientific evidence for this theory, one study has demonstrated that psilocybin does indeed cause reduced blood flow to the posterior cingulate cortex and pre-frontal cortex, which are two areas of the brain considered to be the main nodes of the DMN.[ref to=\"20\" /] Another study has demonstrated that while LSD does not necessarily reduce activity within the DMN, it does desynchronize the brain regions that constitute it.[ref to=\"21\" /] Despite these findings, however, the exact relationship between disruptions of the DMN and the experience of egodeath have not yet been conclusively demonstrated.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n[p]If you've made it this far into the video, thanks so much for watching![/p]\n\n[p]I've really been enjoying making these videos during my freetime recently and I have an essentially endless amount of ideas for video topics and livestreams coming up in the near future. I guess I just want to take a moment to directly thank all of my new and old my patreon supporters. A lot of you have been supporting me for years now, even when it probably seemed like I had disapeared off of the face of the earth.[/p] \n\n[p]In order to improve the value of pledging to me, I recently added a $5+ tier called \"psychonautics advisee\", which essentially means that I will more than happily do my best to casually offer my informal opinions on and answer any questions you may have regarding psychonautics and the general exploration of altered states of consciousness. I am a walking encyclopedia on these topics and have leading expertise in this field, so if you're just starting out or still looking to learn then this could probably be a good option for you.[/p]\n\n[p]Also, if you're looking to join our community and contribute to the field of formalized subjective effect documentation, we do actually have a semi-private but very active discord server and we're always looking for more replicators, artists, creative types, programmers, developers, academics, etc. so if that's something you're interested in, feel free to send me a friend request on discord at the username josikinz#1066. If you're a good fit then I would love to invite you in.[/p]\n\n[p]Thanks again! and i'll see you next time <3[/p]",

      "raw": "[p]A [b]lucid dream[/b] is any [int-link to=\"/effects/dreams\"]dream[/int-link] in which the person is aware that they are dreaming. This is a well-established phenomenon that can occur spontaneously during normal sleep. However, various techniques can also be learned to deliberately and consistently induce these lucid dreams at will. Such techniques can be utilized as a powerful method of consciousness exploration, making lucid dreaming an important field of psychonautics.[/p]\n\n[p]This article is meant to serve as a companion piece to our [int-link to=\"/articles/dreams\"]dreaming[/int-link] article, which comprehensively breaks down and documents the subjective effects which can occur within these dream spaces. Instead of subjective effect documentation, however, this page focuses on serving as an informational guide for learning to consistently gain a stable sense of lucidity within one's own dreams, as well as the instructional techniques for utilizing and harnessing further control of the dream once this has been achieved.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Improving memory recall[/h2]\n[p]One of the biggest hurdles that many encounter when learning to lucid dream is simply being unable to recall the events and details which occurred within their dreams in the first place. This is because many people experience an immediate sense of amnesia upon waking up from a dream. For some people, this sense of amnesia results in the details of their dreams being hazy and non-descript, but for others it can result in them being unable to recall any single aspect of their dreams, in a manner which can cause them to believe that they do not dream at all.[/p]\n\n[p]However, this amnesia can be reduced and does not indicate an inherent inability to dream, but simply means that the dreamer's brain does not focus any attention on memorizing them once they are over. The most effective methods of improving memory recall are listed below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Technique 1\" header=\"Dream journals\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]Writing out any and all details within a daily dream log will drastically improve one's ability to recall their dreams. Preferably, this should be done immediately after waking up if possible. The writing style should be in the first person and in the present tense to further improve one's ability to recall the specific plot as it is written down. If there was no dream the previous night, simply write down \"[i]I did not dream last night[/i]\", then continue to use the journal as usual the next day.[/p]\n\n[p]If this is done on a daily basis, it can quickly change the function of the person's memory into one which is attentive to its own dreams.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Technique 2\" header=\"Memory signifiers\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]Many people will often find that when waking up in the middle of the night, they may briefly remember the dream they were having during this state of being half asleep, before waking back up in the morning only to find that they have completely forgotten it.[/p]\n\n[p]If this is the case, during these brief moments of wakefulness for situations such as drinking water or visiting the bathroom, one can make a small change to their environment that will be noticeable in the morning in a manner which then triggers the recollection of the dream. For example, turning a drinking glass upside down or putting an object on one's computer keyboard can act as a powerful memory trigger when seen the next day, allowing one to then write the dream down in their dream journal.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Technique 3\" header=\"Avoiding cannabis before sleep\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]It is common knowledge among cannabis users that it's regular use before bed suppresses one's ability to dream; this phenomenon has been backed up by a study which indicated that smoking marijuana will inhibit REM activity during sleep, therefore suppressing dreams. Once a person stops smoking marijuana before bed, however, REM activity undergoes a rebound effect and dreams will temporarily become much more vivid than usual.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Reality checks[/h2]\n\n[captioned-image src=\"/img/gallery/are you dreaming.jpg\" align=\"right\" border=\"true\" top=\"true\" artist=\"Unknown\" width=\"400\" caption=\"Changing one's desktop wallpaper to this image as a reminder to perform reality checks will greatly improve one's sense of general lucidity.\" /]\n\n[p]To determine whether or not one is dreaming, it is necessary to develop a habit of performing frequent reality checks. A reality check involves asking questions such as \"[i]Am I dreaming?[/i]\" or \"[i]Is this a dream?[/i]\" while performing a specific action which is capable of determining which one of these potential situations is genuinely the case. This works because there are certain actions which can be performed in real life which will not work in the same way within dreams, and can thus be reliably used as a means of testing this possibility.[/p]\n\n[p]So by training oneself to habitually question and test their reality during waking life, the habit will eventually carry over to dreaming life and, ultimately, one will find themselves posing the same questions while dreaming. When this happens and a reality check \"fails\", the odds of the person realizing that they are in a dream becomes inevitable.[/p]\n\n[p]Listed below are some common reality checks that can be used to reliably and effectively determine whether or not one is currently dreaming:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Reality check 1\" header=\"Pushing your finger through your palm\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]During a dream, if a person attempts to push their thumb into the palm of their other hand, it will usually pass straight through the hand and come out the other side in a manner that feels as if the hand is not a truly solid substance. This seemingly holds true when pushing any finger into one's hand. A one handed variant of this check can also be done by clenching one's middle finger into the palm of its same hand.[/p]\n\n[p]However, it is worth noting that although this reality check is very reliable, there are a few accounts of it not working despite the fact that the person trying it was indeed inside of a dream. It is therefore not recommended for use as the person's primary and only form of habitual reality check.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Reality check 2\" header=\"Re-examining text and clocks\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]During a dream, if a person reads text or checks the time on a clock before double taking and re-examining it, upon further scrutiny the information will consistently have been found to have changed, become nonsensical, or become incapable of keeping still.[/p]\n\n[p]This lack of ability to maintain coherent information of this type between the moments in which a person is directly perceiving it, seems to be an inherent limitation behind the way in which dreams are manifested within the brain. It is because of this that re-examining text and clocks is one of the most effortless and reliable of the standard reality checks.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Reality check 3\" header=\"Counting fingers\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]During a dream, if a person look at their hands and attempt to count their fingers, they will quickly realize it is impossible. This is because the number of fingers may keep changing with each count, the hands and fingers may shapeshift and contort into bizarre forms, and the person may find themselves simply unable to retain the number of fingers which they have counted within their short term memory.[/p]\n\n[p]While it is not possible to say for certain, the manner in which this reality check fails to work within dreams feels as if it is directly related to the same inherent limitation which prevents things such as clocks and text maintaining consistency between double takes. It also seems to be a completely reliable and consistent reality check.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Reality check 4\" header=\"Pinching your nose and breathing through it\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]During a dream, if a person tightly pinches their nose shut and attempts to breathe through their nostrils, they will find that they still can as normal. This is presumably because in real life, the person's physical nostrils remain unobstructed while the bodies automatic breathing process continues as normal. For this same reason, breathing through the mouth or nose will always continue as normal even when the dreamer is placed in situations such as being underwater or in outer space.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]For the best results, reality checks should be performed habitually on a frequent and daily basis. For example, good opportunities to perform a reality check during waking life include situations such as every time one walks through a door or enters a new environment, every time one talks to a new person, and every time the situation generally changes in some significant manner. If this is done 10 - 30 times a day, the habit will quickly pass on to one's dreaming life.[/p]\n\n[p]An excellent way to remind oneself to perform reality checks is to put notes containing messages such as \"[i]are you dreaming?[/i]\" or \"[i]perform a reality check[/i]\" in places that one frequently looks at throughout the day. For example, putting a visible note by or on one's computer screen, writing a message on one's hand, changing one's phone wallpaper to the image found above (or something similar), will all greatly improve a person's general lucidity.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Stabilization[/h2]\n[p]Once lucidity has been achieved, many people find that their dream quickly begins to destabilize, collapse, or fade away in a manner that essentially ends the dream. This typically leads the person to either wake up or fall unconscious before losing lucidity and potentially finding themselves back within another non-lucid dream.[/p] \n\n[p]Although frustrating, the sudden destabilization of dreams can easily be overcome by any means which maintains continuous sensory input. This is most commonly achieved via the basic action of continuously rubbing one's hands together while walking around within and exploring the dream space. This stabilization technique can also be further taken advantage of by continuously rubbing one's shoulder with just one of their hands in order to maintain sensory input while freeing up their other hand to use as a tool for interacting with the dream-space.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Activities and control techniques[/h2]\n[p]Once lucidity has been gained and the dream has been stabilized, the dreamer can now begin to practice taking control of the dream and exploring their own mind. Through the power of expecting an action or task to work, almost anything is possible within the dream-space and this can allow for some truly incredible experiences.[/p]\n\n[p]The most common of these activities and the techniques used to engage in them are listed below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 1\" header=\"Enhancing clarity and detail\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]If the dream is blurred and low in clarity or detail, it is possible to enhance and improve these factors by verbally stating aloud \"[i]enhance visual clarity[/i]\" or another similar statement and simply expecting it to work.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 2\" header=\"Spawning objects\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]If the dreamer wants to spawn objects such as vehicles, weapons, food, people, etc, this can be done through two different methods. The first is walking into a room and simply expecting to find the object in a particular location, and the second is drawing the vague shape of the desired object in the air with their hands while simultaneously verbally commanding the object into existence through expectant dialogue such as \"[i]a jetpack is going to appear in front of me.[/i]\" The more specific the verbal request is, the more accurately the object is to fit the dreamers intentions when it spawns.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 3\" header=\"Travelling to new locations\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]If the dreamer wants to travel to a new location, there are two methods through which this can be done. The first of these is to spawn a door by drawing its shape in the air while stating clearly where they would like it to take them before walking through it. An example of this would be the statement \"[i]this door is going to take me to my childhood home[/i]\".[/p] \n\n[p]The second technique is to verbally state where they would like to visit while simultaneously spinning around in circles. Once they have stopped spinning, they should find themselves in the desired location. The more detailed the verbal request, the more accurate the outcome is likely to be.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 4\" header=\"Flying\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]There are different styles of flight that people use, each with a varied level of success depending on the individual. Methods such as swimming through the air as if it were water, “Superman style” (one arm outstretched), “Airplane style” (both arms out), and \"Bird style\" (gliding through the wind, flapping one's arms to navigate air currents) are often used.[/p]\n\n[p]Regardless of the flight style, there are a few methods of getting up into the air, such as jumping or willing one's body to levitate. However, perhaps the easiest method of flight is to use a flying tool that the dreamer pre-emptively spawns in, such as a jet-pack or witches broomstick.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 5\" header=\"Shape-shifting\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]Many people try to shape-shift into animals, creatures, and other genders by willfully changing their body parts one by one. This is usually ineffective, as the body often changes back quicker than one can complete the process. A much more effective technique is to turn the transformation into an instant process by spawning a tool which will help one to transform. An example of this would be to spawn a magical transformation pill which can be swallowed or a magical wand which can be waved in order to instantly transform one into their desired form.[/p]\n\n[p]Another surprisingly effective shape-shifting technique is to posses the body of an already existing person, animal or creature. This can be done through the bizarre but simple method of climb into them from behind and wearing their body over one's own skin in a manner that is similar to that of a wet-suit.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 6\" header=\"Having sex\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]Although it is potentially a somewhat taboo topic, many people learn to lucid dream purely for sexual reasons. This can often be unexpectedly difficult, as it is often very challenging to maintain lucidity during the act of dream sex and the chosen partner may even shift into an undesirable form part way through. However, in order to have sex within a lucid dream, all one needs to do is simply initiate it with a dream character.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 7\" header=\"Taking drugs\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]An interesting way to change the course of the dream is to ingest drugs which the dreamer may or may not have tried in real life. This will result in inducing a variety of unique and unexpected changes to the dreamers mood and perception, which may or may not line up with the effects which the real life substance actually induces.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 8\" header=\"Eating food\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]Another great activity to engage in within dreams is the simple act of eating food. This is because the experience of eating food within a dream can feel and taste completely realistic, resulting in an extremely pleasurable experience which is genuinely very satisfying.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Alternative/Advanced techniques[/h2]\n[p]Outside of the more common and standard technique of habitually practicing reality checks in order to obtain lucidity within dreams, there are a number of advance and alternative techniques that can be used for similar purposes. Listed below are just a few of the most common advance techniques, each with links to more detailed tutorials that are hosted on other websites.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"FILD\" header=\"Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]FILD (Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming)[/i] is defined as the act of waking up from deep sleep in the middle of the night, before performing light repetitive movements with your fingers as if you were playing the piano with your index and middle finger, and then allowing the body to drift off to sleep while this action is being performed. This process usually lasts for several seconds to a few minutes, but if performed successfully it can allow the person to enter into a dream state while still remaining fully conscious.[/p] \n\n[p]A much more detailed instructional tutorial can be found within this article [ext-link to=\"https://www.thelucidguide.com/Techniques/Finger%2FFocus-Induced-Lucid-Dream-%28FILD%29]here[/ext-link].[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"WILD\" header=\"Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]WILD (Wake Initiated Lucid Dream)[/i] was coined by Dr. Stephen LaBerge, a psychophysiologist who specialized in the study of dreams. It is used to refer to any lucid dream where the dreamer brings their woken awareness into a dream while falling asleep. This is in contrast to DILD (Dream Initiated Lucid Dream) in which the dreamer becomes aware that they are in a dream while inside it.[/p]\n\n[p]WILD is usually considered to be an advanced lucid dreaming technique.

The eye represents an observer and the line directly opposite represents that which it is perceiving within the external environment. The two sections are connected into each other via arrows to demonstrate that they are a singular and unified system.\"|align=\"right\"The fifth level of identity alteration can be defined as feeling as if one's identity is simultaneously attributed to the entirety of the immediately perceivable external environment and all known concepts that exist outside of it. These known concepts typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe as it presently stands in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted by people as becoming one with the universe.\n\nWhen experienced, the effect creates the sudden perspective that the person is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through the specific point in space and time which this particular body and conscious perception happens to currently reside within. People who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of supposedly profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.”\n\nAlthough they are not necessarily literal truths about reality, at this point, many commonly reported conclusions of a religious and metaphysical nature often begin to manifest themselves as profound realizations. These are described below:\n\n##md{- The sudden and total acceptance of death as a fundamental complement of life. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of a person, but simply the end of this specific point of a greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist and live on through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as an inevitable, and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment, but simply a fact of reality.\n- The subjective perspective that the person's preconceived notions of \"god\" or deities can be felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all possible power (omnipotence), all possible knowledge (omniscience), is self-creating, and self-sustaining then on either a semantic or literal level the universe and its contents could also be viewed as god.\n- The subjective perspective that the person, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all of humanity's sufferings and flaws but also includes its acts of love and achievements.}\nThis state most commonly occurs during intense states of well-practiced meditation or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.\n"

For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively their “ego” or a combination of their “ego” and physical body, during this state their sense of identity can change to include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. Alternatively, a person could feel as if their sense of self embodies nothing at all, which is an experience commonly referred to as [int-link to=\"/effects/depersonalization\"]depersonalization[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]There are a total of 5 distinct levels of identity which a person can experience. These various altered states of identity have been arranged into a levelling system that orders its different states from least to the most number of concepts one's identity is currently attributed to. These levels are described and documented below:[/p]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Total absence of attributed identity\" subHeader=\"depersonalization\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]The lowest level of identity can be described as the sensation that there is a complete absence of having any sense of self at all. This is referred to in psychiatry as \"[int-link to=\"/effects/depersonalization\"]depersonalization[/int-link]\". It can be described as an anomaly of self-awareness that consists of a feeling of watching oneself act as one normally would, while also feeling is if they have no control over the situation. During this state, the affected person may feel that they are \"on autopilot\" and that the world has become vague, dreamlike, less real, or lacking in significance. Individuals who experience depersonalization often feel divorced from their own personal physicality by no longer sensing their body sensations, feelings, emotions, and behaviours as belonging to a person or identity. It is also often claimed by people who have depersonalization that reality seems unreal, distant or hazy.[/p]\n\n[p]Depersonalization can sometimes be distressing to the user, who may become disoriented by the loss of a sense that their self is the origin of their thoughts and actions. However, it does not have to be an inherently negative altered state of awareness, as it does not directly affect one's emotions or thought patterns.[/p]\n\n[p]It is perfectly normal for many people to slip into this state temporarily, often without even realizing it. For example, many people often note that they enter a detached state of autopilot during stressful situations or when performing monotonous routine tasks such as driving.[/p]\n\n[p]Within the context of identity-altering effects, depersonalization can be considered as being at the opposite end of the identity spectrum relative to states of ##int-link|to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"{unity and interconnectedness}. This is because, during depersonalization, a person senses and attributes their identity to nothing, giving a sense of having no self. However, during a state of unity and interconnectedness, one senses and attributes their identity to everything, giving a sense that the entirety of existence is their self.[/p]\n\n[p]Depersonalization is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as anxiety and a very similar psychological disorder known as derealization. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] compounds, such as ketamine, PCP, and [int-link=\"/substances/dxm/\"]DXM[/int-link]. However, it can also occur to a lesser extent during the withdrawal symptoms of stimulants and depressants.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Self-contained separate identity\" subHeader=\"neurotypical ego's\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]The second level of identity can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to their brain and/or body. This is often said to feel as if one is a consciousness, the guiding force located within a body which is immersed in and interacting with a distinctly separate external environment. It is usually accompanied with a sense of free will or agency over all the thoughts and actions the person makes, which results in them feeling as if their decision-making processes are arising from an internal source which is not necessarily determined by cause and effect in the same manner as external systems.[/p]\n\n[p]A self-contained separate identity is by far the most common form of identity. Mainstream Western cultural notions consider this conception of identity to be the self-evident and logical way to perceive the world as well as the only form of identity which isn't intrinsically delusional. Despite being culturally normative, this belief has received considerable debate and criticism within modern neuroscience and philosophy.[/p]\n\n[p]Although drastically altered in comparison to that of sobriety, it is also worth noting that hallucinatory states such as ego replacement and 2nd person ##int-link|to=\"/effects/perspective-hallucination\"{perspective hallucinations} typically still fall under the classification of this level. In both cases, a person still feels as if they are a separate agent facing the external world, but have the perception of being a different identity than their sober self.\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Identifying with specific external systems\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]The third level of identity alteration can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to (in addition to the body and/or brain) specific external systems or concepts within the immediate environment, particularly those that would usually be considered as intrinsically separate from one's own being.[/p]\n\n[p]The experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the specific physical systems or concepts within the perceivable external environment which are currently the subjects of their thoughts or focus. This creates a sensation of becoming inextricably \"connected to\", \"one with\", \"the same as\", or \"unified\" with whatever the perceived external system happens to be.[/p]\n\n[p]There are an endless number of ways in which this level manifests itself, but common examples of the experience often include:[/p]\n\n##md{- Becoming unified with and identifying with a specific object one is interacting with.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with another person or multiple people, particularly common if engaging in sexual or romantic activities.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with the entirety of one's own physical body.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with large crowds of people, particularly common at raves and music festivals.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with the external environment, but not the people within it.}\nThis level of identity alteration most commonly occurs during intense states of focus, meditation, or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Identifying with all perceivable external\" systems\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]The fourth level of identity alteration can be defined as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to the entirety of their immediately perceivable external environment.[/p]\n\n[p]The experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the entirety of their sensory input or the currently perceivable external environment. It creates a sensation in the person that they have “become one with their surroundings.” This is felt to be the result of a person’s sense of self becoming attributed to not just primarily the internal narrative of the ego, but in equal measure to the body itself and everything around it which it is physically perceiving through the senses. This sensation creates the compelling perspective that the person is the external environment experiencing itself through a specific point within it, namely the physical sensory perceptions of the body their consciousness currently resides in.[/p]\n\n[p]It is at this point that a key component of the high-level identity alteration experience becomes an extremely noticeable factor. Once a person's sense of self has become attributed to the entirety of their surroundings, this new perspective completely changes how it feels to physically interact with what was previously felt to be an external environment. For example, when a person is not in this state and is interacting with a physical object, it typically feels as though they are a central agent acting on the separate world around them.[/p]\n\n[p]However, while undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object consistently feels as if the whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself with no central, separate agent operating the process of interaction. Instead, the process suddenly feels as if it has become completely decentralized and holistic, as the environment begins to autonomously and harmoniously respond to itself in a predetermined manner to perform the interaction carried out by the individual.[/p]\n\n[p]This level of identity alteration most commonly occurs during intense states of focus, meditation, or under the influence of hallucinogens such as ##int-link|to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"{psychedelics}.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Identifying with all known external systems\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n##cap-img|src=\"/img/gallery/Artistic_depiction_of_unity.png\"|top=\"true\"|border=\"true\"|width=\"250\"|artist=\"John Archibald Wheeler\"|title=\"Self Excited Circuit\"|caption=\"This symbol depicts the universe as a self-excited circuit. The eye represents an observer and the line directly opposite represents that which it is perceiving within the external environment. The two sections are connected into each other via arrows to demonstrate that they are a singular and unified system.\"|align=\"right\"The fifth level of identity alteration can be defined as feeling as if one's identity is simultaneously attributed to the entirety of the immediately perceivable external environment and all known concepts that exist outside of it. These known concepts typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe as it presently stands in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted by people as becoming one with the universe.\n\nWhen experienced, the effect creates the sudden perspective that the person is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through the specific point in space and time which this particular body and conscious perception happens to currently reside within. People who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of supposedly profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.”\n\nAlthough they are not necessarily literal truths about reality, at this point, many commonly reported conclusions of a religious and metaphysical nature often begin to manifest themselves as profound realizations. These are described below:\n\n##md{- The sudden and total acceptance of death as a fundamental complement of life. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of a person, but simply the end of this specific point of a greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist and live on through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as an inevitable, and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment, but simply a fact of reality.\n- The subjective perspective that the person's preconceived notions of \"god\" or deities can be felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all possible power (omnipotence), all possible knowledge (omniscience), is self-creating, and self-sustaining then on either a semantic or literal level the universe and its contents could also be viewed as god.\n- The subjective perspective that the person, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all of humanity's sufferings and flaws but also includes its acts of love and achievements.}\nThis state most commonly occurs during intense states of well-practiced meditation or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[h2 id=\"further-reading\"]Further reading[/h2]\n\n[p]Similar accounts of the experience of unity with the universe and the apparent illusory nature of the self can be found across a surprisingly large variety of independent religious, philosophical, and psychological sources.

A mild experience is the level at which the effects become noticeable and clearly distinct from sobriety while still partially remaining in the background of a person's awareness. At this level, the effects can be partially ignored by directing one's focus towards other stimuli, tasks, or the external environment. Depending on a person's experience with psychedelics, personality, and whether they are engaged in immersive activities, they may be able to suppress the effects, but someone who is embracing the experience will typically have a mild but noticeable alteration of their experience or understanding of the world around them.

A moderate experience is the level at which the effects and the nature of the substance become clear and defined enough that ignoring its action becomes difficult. At this level, the person will still generally just about be able to partake in regular behaviours and remain functional whilst maintaining the ability to communicate properly. Depending on the person's level of experience, the effects can be allowed to occupy a predominant role within the person's perception, or they may be ignored and made somewhat secondary to other chosen activities. At this level, people are typically able to engage in regular behaviours and maintain the ability to communicate properly, though there will likely be noticeable impairments in concentration and short term memory that may be overcome with effort.

      "raw": "\n\n[p][b]Meditation[/b] is a practice in which an individual trains the mind or induces a mode of consciousness, either to realize some benefit, allow the mind to simply acknowledge its content without becoming identified with that content,[1] or as an end in itself.[2][/p]\n\n[p]The term meditation refers to a broad variety of practices that includes techniques designed to promote relaxation and develop compassion,[3] love, patience, generosity and forgiveness. A particularly ambitious form of meditation aims at effortlessly sustained single-pointed concentration[4] meant to enable its practitioner to enjoy a heightened sense of well-being while engaging in any life activity.[/p]\n\n[p]The word meditation carries different meanings in different contexts. Meditation has been practiced since antiquity as a component of numerous religious traditions and beliefs.[5] Meditation often involves an internal effort to self-regulate the mind in some way. Meditation is often used to clear the mind and ease many health concerns such as high blood pressure,[6] depression and anxiety. It may be done sitting or in an active way; for instance, Buddhist monks involve awareness in their day-to-day activities as a form of mind-training. Prayer beads or other ritual objects are commonly used during meditation in order to keep track of or remind the practitioner about some aspect of the training.[/p]\n\n[p]It is worth noting, however, that despite the inconsistencies across cultural practices, universal techniques remain across all methodologies and this article will attempt to define and document these consistencies in a manner that is informative, rational, scientific and generally helpful for those who wish to pursue this deeply profound field of psychonautics. The biggest problem with defining a meditative technique is that there are many cultural and historical definitions which make different claims regarding the specifics of this subject.[/p]\n\n[p]In order to overcome these problems and document meditation as a whole, a simple and usable open source technique and set of information have been devised to define a generalized meditation methodology and its different components. The meditation technique will be presented in a manner that encompasses the culturally specific methods which are consistent across each other. This is with the belief that the subjective effects of the technique will be equal or greater in efficiency than other specific cultural practices.[/p]\n[hr /][markdown text=\"### Mindfulness practice\" /][p]The most important and universal aspect of a meditative practice is mindfulness. This is a concept which is present in most if not all culturally specific forms of meditation in various forms usually consisting of the practice of some sort of self regulation. It can also be induced as a subjective effect by many psychoactive compounds, but is also primarily and formally something that can be consciously practiced and maintained through a set of specific actions or techniques.[/p]\n\n[p]It can be broken down into two distinct sub-components.[/p]\n\n[p]The first of these components involves the self-regulation of attention so that its focus is completely directed towards immediate experience, thereby quieting a person's internal narrative and allowing for increased recognition of external and mental events within the present moment. As thoughts come up, the practitioner returns to focusing on their present senses without developing the thought. This is repeated with the intention of quieting the mind.[/p]\n\n[p]The second component involves adopting a particular orientation towards one’s experiences in the present moment that is characterized by a lack of judgement, curiosity, openness and acceptance.[/p]\n\n[p]The average human being who attempts to quiet their thoughts will notice that their inner monologue will autonomously interject and distract one from the task at hand in a fashion which seems entirely uncontrollable. This is perfectly ordinary; as thoughts come up, a practitioner must passively notice that their mind has wandered, but in an accepting and non-judgemental way before returning the attention of their awareness into simply focusing on the present moment.[/p]\n\n[p]There are a number of techniques or tasks which people perform during this act of focus. These are practically universal and commonly include:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Technique 1\" header=\"Breath-based focus\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]During the performance of this task as an act of meditation, attention is placed upon the movement of the abdomen when breathing in and out,[7] or on the awareness of the breath as it goes in and out the nostrils. The breath is noticed as it moves in and out as the body inhales and exhales. One should notice how the breath moves in and out automatically and effortlessly and should not try to manipulate it in any way. The details of the experience of breathing such as the feeling of the air moving in and out of the nose or the way the body moves as it breathes should also be noticed.[/p]\n\n[p]As thoughts come up, one returns to focusing on breathing, passively noticing one's mind has wandered, but in an accepting and non-judgemental way.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Technique 2\" header=\"Mantra-based focus\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]This is perhaps the easiest form of meditative focus as it is harder to be distracted from than others.[/p]\n\n[p]During the performance of this task as an act of meditation, attention is placed upon the repetition of a repeated and outwardly spoken phrase of one's own choosing. This phrase can be anything such as simple counting, but it is worth noting that a phrase with personal significance is often most effective.[/p]\n\n[p]As thoughts come up, one returns to focusing on repeating their mantra, passively noticing one's mind has wandered, but in an accepting and non-judgmental way.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Technique 3\" header=\"Miscellaneous task-based focus\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]During this, mindfulness is intensively placed upon the act of upholding a task of any sort with varying levels of difficulty depending on what one chooses. This could include a range of things from walking, exercising, producing artwork, performing household chores, holding a conversation or any everyday task that one can think of. During this meditative focus, one concentrates on all of the senses available to them during it.[/p]\n\n[p]As thoughts come up, one returns to focusing on the task, passively noticing one's mind has wandered, but in an accepting and non-judgemental way.[/p]\n\n[p]A famous exercise, introduced by Kabat-Zinn in his MBSR program, is the mindful tasting and eating of a raisin.[8][9] Another popular example of task-based focus meditation is the practice of yoga.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n[hr /][markdown text=\"### Regular usage\" /][p]It is important to understand that unlike psychoactive substances, the effects and benefits of meditation are not instantaneous; they are accumulative in a manner which proportionally builds up with persistent repetitive practice over longer periods of time. For example, despite the initial impatience many people experience, a mediation routine of 10 - 60 minutes a day can drastically change one's default, sober day to day perspective in a profound and beneficial way. This is due to the way in which meditation induces persistent beneficial subjective effects throughout daily life.[/p]\n\n[p]It has been clinically demonstrated that those who begin 30 minutes of mindfulness mediation practice a day demonstrate detectable changes within their brain structure and report a number of positive effects involving memory, sense of self, empathy, stress, and overall well-being after eight weeks.[10] This demonstrates that even short-term periods of regular meditation have a clinically significant and measurable therapeutic effect on a neurological level.[/p]\n\n[p]Therefore, if one wishes to fully experience the changes in perception which meditation has to offer then they must maintain a persistent routine for as much and as long as reasonably possible.[/p]\n\n[hr /][markdown text=\"### Position\" /][p]There are a multitude of positions which one can meditate with. These range from lying down or sitting to standing or walking. For personal usage, it is optimum to find a position which suits one best. Retaining a consistent position across sessions can allow one to associate this position with a meditative state and therefore assist in one's practice.[/p]\n\n[p]It is also worth noting that retaining a healthy upright posture throughout prolonged meditative techniques is extremely important and that if one is having trouble with this, they should consider moving to a comfortable chair. One should avoid lying down on a comfortable bed or similar surface. This is because doing so can result in sleep and therefore less efficient meditation.[/p]\n[captioned-image src=\"/img/gallery/Meditation-poses.jpg\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\" /]\nAbove are a few potential meditation poses which one may find useful to try.\n[hr /][markdown text=\"### Guided meditation\" /]\n[p]There are certain people who practice meditation but prefer to use guided meditations. This is particularly true if the practitioner is inexperienced. The three audio files below contain examples of well-constructed guided meditation sessions which can be use to assist in one's meditation. Many other examples of guided meditation practices with inconsistent levels of quality can be found across Youtube and Google.[/p]\n\n[audio-player src=\"/audio/sam harris 9 minutes.ogg\" title=\"9 minute guided meditation.\" artist=\"Sam Harris\" /][audio-player src=\"/audio/sam harris 26 minutes.ogg\" title=\"26 minute guided meditation.\" artist=\"Sam Harris\" /][audio-player src=\"/audio/alan watts guided meditation.ogg\" title=\"15 minute guided meditation.\" artist=\"Alan Watts\" /][hr /][markdown text=\"### Subjective effects\" /]\n[p]The effects listed below are based upon the subjective effects index and personal experiences of PsychonautWiki contributors. The listed effects will rarely (if ever) occur all at once and cognitive effects are most common. A persistent and dedicated practice will increase the chances of effects occurring and is more likely to induce a full range of effects.[/p]\n\n[p]It is worth noting that whilst many of these effects occur only during states of active meditation, the cognitive effects specifically carry on into everyday life and become more prominent with persistent and regular practice. This is perhaps the most useful aspect of developing a meditation routine and by far the most significant source of its cultural and historical prominence.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Category 1\" header=\"Cognitive effects\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]The general cognitive effects of maintaining a consistent meditation routine can be broken down into several components.[/p]\n\n[p]These are described below and generally include:[/p]\n- **Mindfulness** - This particular component is perhaps by far the most prominent effect of regular meditation and this is demonstrated within the modern meditative literature.[11] There has been a heavy focus on the mindfulness aspects of meditation techniques within the scientific literature in order to avoid the cultural, mythological and religious connotations which meditation is usually associated with.\n- **Enhancements** - Analysis enhancement, Introspection, Empathy, love, and sociability enhancement, Focus enhancement, Motivation enhancement, Thought connectivity, Novelty enhancement, Creativity enhancement, Rejuvenation\n- **Suppressions** - Anxiety suppression[15][16][17], Personal bias suppression, Memory suppression, Ego death\n- **Novel states** - Conceptual thinking, Cognitive euphoria, Depersonalization, Time distortion\n- **Spiritual states** - Although the same states can easily occur within a single session under the influence of psychedelic compounds, within the context of meditation these particular states may take years or even decades of practice to experience.[/headered-textbox]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Category 2\" header=\"Physical effects\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]The physical effects of meditation can be broken down into a couple of components which progressively intensify with persistent practice. They exclusively occur during the meditative state and do not persist during conscious life in the same way that the cognitive effects do.[/p]\n\n[p]These are described below and generally include:[/p]\n\nBodily control enhancement, Physical euphoria, Tactile disconnection, Tactile enhancement, Spontaneous tactile sensations, Changes in gravity[/headered-textbox]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Category 3\" header=\"Visual effects\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]The visual effects of a consistent meditation routine will only occur for a very small subset of people and are not considered to be a universal experience. They are usually experienced by those who have past experience with hallucinogens or those who are naturally susceptible to such states.[/p]\n\n[p]As with other aspects of meditation, they progressively intensify with persistent practice. However, they exclusively occur during the meditative state and do not begin to persist during conscious life in the same way that the cognitive effects do.[/p]\n\n[p]These are described below and generally include:[/p]\n\n- **Internal hallucinations** - The internal hallucinations of meditation can be described as more solid than psychedelics and do not seem to be composed of visual geometry. The most common way in which they manifest themselves are through spontaneous and fleeting hypnagogic scenarios. They are most common during deeper meditative states and can be comprehensively described through their variations as lucid in believability, fixed in style, autonomous in controllability, and equal in new experiences and memory replays in content.\n- **Geometry** - The geometry experienced with meditation rarely occurs in those without previous psychedelic experiences. It does not not adhere to any particular set of variations in style. Instead it is usually an averaged out, blended or merged stylistic version of all of the psychedelics which one has previous experience with.\n\n[/headered-textbox][hr /][markdown text=\"### Culturally specific meditation techniques\" /][p]Throughout history and culture, there have been many different branches of meditation and its techniques. Although the manners in which they are performed varies, these techniques each follow relatively consistent themes of focusing on external stimuli or the present moment whilst avoiding wandering thought as a means to achieve inner peace.[/p]\n\n[markdown text=\"**Secular meditative techniques**\n\n- [Mindfulness meditation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness#Mindfulness_meditation)\n- Transcendental meditation\n- Open source meditation\" /]\n[markdown text=\"**Religious meditative techniques**\n\n- Christian meditation\n- Daoist meditation\n- Jain meditation\n- Jewish meditation\n- Sikh meditation\n- Kundalini meditation\" /][hr /][markdown text=\"### References\" /]\n Attention regulation and monitoring in meditation (PubMed.gov / NCBI) | https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18329323\n Watts, Alan. \"11 _10-4-1 Meditation.\" Eastern Wisdom: Zen in the West & Meditations.

In this video I'm going to document and describe the psychedelic manifestation of the specific subjective effect which is known as an Internal Hallucination.[/p]\n\n[p]This will be in accordance with the terminology laid out within our comprehensive Subjective Effect Index and will be done without resorting to metaphors, analogies, or personal trip reports. To give you a better sense of the experience, to the best of our abilities we've also accompanied each description with relevant image and video replications.[/p]\n\n[p]As for the effect itself, an internal hallucination is defined as the perception of a visual hallucination that primarily occurs within an imagined inner environment that is on the back of the users eyelids, in a manner that is similar to that of dreams. In terms of appearance, these hallucinations are also commonly comprised from and embedded within condensed psychedelic geometry, which gives them an incredibly complex, incomprehensible, and otherworldly aesthetic that is clearly demonstrated within the countless examples of visionary artwork shown here within this video.[/p]\n\n[p]To varying degrees, this effect is an extremely common experience at sufficiently heavy dosages of almost any psychedelic compound, with substances such as [i]DMT, ayahuasca, psilocybin, mescaline, and 2C-E[/i] being just some of the more reliable substances for inducing this particlar effect. However, the amount of hallucinatory content experienced during high level psychedelic states tends to vary from person to person, with many people also finding that certain substances are more hallucinatory for them than others.[/p]\n\n[p]It's also worth noting that the internal nature of these hallcunations occur in stark phenomonological contrast to the related subjective effect known as an [i]external hallucination[/i], which can display itself seamlessly into the persons surrounding environment as if it were physically present. I think this is an important distinction to make, because while much less complex hallucinatory effects such as [i]increased pareidolia[/i]... and [i]transformations[/i] do frequently happen during psychedelic experiences, fully formed external hallucinations are quite uncommon and thus usually more associated with deliriant hallucinogens, rather than traditional psychedelics. It's because of this that I am focusing the content on this particular video purely on [i]internal[/i] rather than [i]external[/i] hallucinations, which will have to be directly covered within a future video.[/p]\n\n[p]So at [i]lower levels[/i], internal hallucinations begin with imagery on the back of a person's eyelids, which do not take up the entirety of one's visual field and are generally distinct from their background. This imagery is manifested in varying levels of realism, ranging from ill-defined and cartoon-like to wholly realistic. Once present, they rarely hold their form for more than a few seconds before fading or shifting into another image. This level of intensity also feels incredibly reminiscent to that of hypnagogia, the hallucinatory dream state that many people experience as they are in the process of drifting off to sleep while still remaining partially awake.[/p]\n\n[p]At [i]higher levels[/i], internal hallucinations become increasingly elaborate as they eventually become all-encompassing, fully-fledged 3D scenes that surround the person in a manner similar to that of an extremely vivid [int-link to=\"/effects/dreams\"]dream[/int-link]. This can create the feeling that one has \"broken-through\" into another reality. The things that occur within this perceived alternate reality can be anything, but fall under common archetypes and specific subcomponents such as contact with [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link], incredibly elaborate but often nonsenscial scenarios and plots, within a wide variety of [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]imagined settings, sceneries, and landscapes[/int-link]. Each of which can be classified as distinct subjective effects of their own, with extensive documentation within the subjective effect index that will have to be more fully covered within a number of future videos.[/p]\n\n[p]As for a more precise analysis of the varying degrees of complexity and vividness of this experience, it seems to be proportional to the dosage of the substance consumed. With heavier dosages of a given psychedelic substance producing more concrete and fully fledged hallucinations and lower dosages merely producing fleeting imagery. So in an attempt to comprehensively document the full spectrum of this experience, I have concluded that internal hallucinations are capable of manifesting themselves across the following 5 distinct levels of increasing intensity.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Enhancement of mental visualization\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, internal hallucinations can be defined as a distinct enhancement of the mental visualisation that a person drifts into while daydreaming or using their imagination. This can be described as a short-term detachment from one’s immediate surroundings; during which, a person’s contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by an ill-defined fantasy that is not directly seen in the traditional sense, but is instead felt within one's mind eye. The details of this internal visualisation are also chosen in a slightly spontaneous or autonomous nature, but are mostly consciously controlled by the content of one’s current thought stream.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, internal hallucinations consist of partially defined, blurred, and faded imagery within a person’s visual field. This is where the content of these hallucinations usually becomes more spontaneous in nature and out of the person’s conscious control.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the vividness and intensity increases in a fashion that renders the imagery seen within one’s visual field as fully defined and realistic in its appearance.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the vividness, scope, and intensity of the hallucinations become all-encompassing in a way that displays momentary flashes of fully fledged scenes that surround the person in an immersive environment, similar to that of a vague dream. Although all-encompassing, however, they are still often blurred or transparent in appearance, and the person’s physical senses remain partially connected to the real world.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the highest level, the internal hallucinations further increase to become all-encompassing in a manner that displays long-lasting scenes surrounding the person with an explorable and fully immersive environment similar to that of a dream. This occurs in a fashion that is fully detailed and highly vivid in its appearance. Typically, it also occurs alongside relevant [int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-hallucination\"]auditory[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/tactile-hallucination\"]tactile hallucinations[/int-link], as well as the sensation that a person has become completely disconnected from their physical body.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]Outside of this levelling system, the subjective intensity of internal hallucinations are not only dependent on their detail or level of immersion, but also upon the speed and rate at which they successively occur between each other. For example, during this experience, it is possible to find oneself in a state that presents a relentless stream of intensely vivid hallucinations. This occurs at such a rapid rate that it eventually becomes psychologically exhausting to endure them, regardless of their thematic content. The sheer amount of content experienced in this state often results in powerful [int-link to=\"/effects/time-distortion?s=Time-dilation\"]time dilation[/int-link], which seems to stem from the fact that abnormally large amounts of experiences are being felt in very short periods of time. This is also consistently accompanied by states of sensory overload and [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link] in a manner that can subjectively feel as if it is a consequence of the brain allocating all of its processing power into rendering hallucinations at the expense of other cognitive faculties.[/p]\n\n[p]Regardless of intensity, the content, style, and general behaviour of an internal hallucination is seemingly often dependent on the emotional state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person who is emotionally stable and generally happy will usually be more prone to experiencing neutral, interesting, beautiful, or positive hallucinations. In contrast, however, a person who is emotionally unstable and generally unhappy will usually be more prone to experiencing sinister, fear-inducing, and negative hallucinations.[/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Style Variations[/h2]\n\n[p]Depending on the person and the specific substance consumed, psychedelic hallucinations can manifest in an incredibly wide variety of aesthetic styles that are often subjectively interpreted quite differently between people. For example, many people report that hallucinations under the influence of 2C-E are cartoonish and digital in their presentation, but in contrast however, many people report that equivalent states under the influence of psilocybin are much more likely to be realistic and organic in their general aesthetic styles.[/p]\n\n[p]Alongside of variations in aesthetic style, many psychedelic users also seem to report substantial differences in the thematic content of their hallucinations between both specific substances and the people which use them. This is in a manner which seems to play off of both a given individuals personal interests, the subjective effect profile of a given substance, and the cultural associations that a person may or may not have with that same substance.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of less subjective potential stylistic differences, the patterns experienced during this state can be broken down into a wide range of approximate stylistic variations which include but are certainly not limited to the following examples:[/p]\n\n[separated-textbox a=\"Lucid\" b=\"Delirious\"]A person experiencing a lucid hallucinatory state can maintain a consistent level of awareness regarding the fact that none of these events are actually occurring and the effects are simply the result of a drug-induced hallucination. In contrast, however, delirious hallucinations may become completely believable in a reflexive manner that occurs no matter how nonsensical they may be. [/separated-textbox]\n[separated-textbox a=\"Fixed\" b=\"Interactive\"]Internal hallucinations can present themselves as fixed in their content in a manner that is similar to watching a video play out in front of one’s field of vision. In contrast, they may also be interactive, allowing one to do things such as converse with entities or interact with imagined objects, similarly to that of a dream or virtual reality video game.[/separated-textbox]\n[separated-textbox a=\"New experiences\" b=\"Old experiences\"]In terms of their subject matter, hallucinations can either be entirely new experiences or they can be old, everyday experiences in the form of [int-link to=\"/effects/effects/memory-replays\"]replayed memories[/int-link].[/separated-textbox]\n[separated-textbox a=\"Controllable\" b=\"Autonomous\"]The content of hallucinations can be partially to completely controllable, or they can be seemingly entirely random in nature. For example, when controllable, their content seems to perfectly follow and fit the general subject matter of one’s current thought stream, with varying levels of configurability. In contrast, autonomous hallucinations are presented as completely spontaneous in their subject matter and entirely uncontrollable.[/separated-textbox]\n[separated-textbox a=\"Geometry-based\" b=\"Solid\"]Hallucinations can be comprised of condensed [int-link to=\"/effects/effects/effects/geometry\"]psychedelic geometry[/int-link] or they can appear to be made from realistic and/or lifelike materials. This is usually dependent upon the type of substance consumed, with the former being more common than the latter when under the influence of psychedelic compounds.[/separated-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Personal commentary[/h2]\n\n[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"][p]Now to wrap this video up, I'd just like to make few points. So based upon my own personal exploartion over the years, i can safely say that psychedelic hallucinations can offer a near infinite wealth of experiences and show people things so unfathomably detailed, intricate, and vivid that they are often incomprehensible beyond anything that would ever occur within daily sober living. This understandably leads many people into the belief that some if not all psychedelic hallucinations, are not simply fabrications of the mind but are instead glimpses into an external reality that exists independently of human consicousness.[/p]\n\n[p]However, after a lot of contemplation and experiences with both hallucinatory states and lucid dreaming, I now strongly suspect that internal hallucinations are quite likely to be the drug induced equivalent of the various scenes that most people commonly encounter within their [int-link to=\"/effects/dreams/\"]dreams[/int-link]. This is because there are a number of interesting commonalities between dreams and hallucinations that are too substantial for me to ignore. For example, I think it is interesting that when leaving a sudden onset hallucination induced by a substance such as DMT, there is often a feeling of amnesia that's identical to the feeling of waking up from a dream. Alongside of this, there is often an identical sense of plot acceptance within both dreams and hallucinations that results in the person immediately accepting their current situation as a real life event.[/p]\n\n[p]From personal experience, I can also confirm that the well established \"reality checks\" that can be used within Lucid Dreams to determine whether or not one is currently awake or asleep, do in fact work just as well within high-level drug induced hallucinations. For example, within a dream, subtle details such as written text and clock faces are seemingly incapable of rendering in a static manner. So if a person looks at one of these things, takes note of them, looks away, and then looks back, they will find without fail that the content suddenly changes its appearance each and every single time. This is also true for internal hallucinations in exactly the same manner, and remains true for all of the other standard lucid dreaming reality checks.[/p]\n\n[p]On a less important note, I think it's interesting to consider that the leveling system listed above can not only be applied to internal hallucinations, but can also be applied to the experience of hypnagogia and fully fledged dreams without any significant modifications to its wording. Alongside of this, the levelling system that I devised to measure the coherency of an autonomous entities communication methods can also be perfectly applied to that of dream characters without any modification at all. This was completely unintentional for both of these leveling systems but is, in my personal opinion atleast, not a coincidence.[/p]\n\n[p]So although it could be argued that internal hallucinations are too characteristically different from that of dreams to possibly stem from the similar neurological processes, I think that these differences in their presentation are largely the result of the many other effects that are often simultaneously occurring during these experiences. The most notable one being geometry, which can cause the hallucination to be comprised of the otherworldly shapes and patterns that provide psychedelic hallucinations in particular with their distinctly \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. Alongside of this, various other subjective effects such as synaesthesia, machinescapes, recursion, time distortion, and transpersonal states can all potentially further synergize with the experience.[/p]\n\n[p]However, I am fully aware that this position is merely one of pure speculation and that I cannot prove this definitively. As the years go by, I am therefore hoping that further scientific research and study into this topic will be able to help elucidate the precise neurological mechanisms behind this fascinating experience.[/p][/quote]\n\n[hr/]\nif you've made it this far into the video, thanks so much for watching! \n\n[p]i just want to thank all of the replicators and artists that helped create the content used here. if you liked what you saw please go check out everyone's social media handles within the links in the description below. you'd probably also enjoy our website at effectindex.com and our subreddit at r/replications.[/p]\n\n[p]Also, while i'm here, if you're looking to join our community and contribute to the field of formalized subjective effect documentation, we do actually have a semi-private but very active discord server and we're always looking for more replicators artists creative types programmers developers academics etc. so if that's something you're interested in feel free to send me a friend request on discord at the username josikinz#1066 and if you're a good fit then i would love to invite you in.[/p]\n\n[p]i'm definitely trying to turn this content into an ongoing series and i fully intend to keep churning out more content like this to the best of my abilities. i pretty much have an endless amount of self-created and pre-written content that i'm really excited to export into various youtube videos, so if you like this sort of stuff then please consider checking out my patreon but if not then no worries either way thanks again for watching and have a lovely day[/p]",

This will initially be achieved by the [int-link to=\"/profiles/Josie\"]site's founder[/int-link] employing her first-hand knowledge of hallucinogenic substances and the subjective effects they induce. Eventually we will establish a more refined methodology by employing a small team ingesting these substances at a range of dosages, and documenting their experiences through the use of standardized [int-link to=\"/reports/\"]trip reports[/int-link] using our [ext-link to=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/1VdkmHgkng78fPrpqIFd7qDti5B7ml_oD8ZFiHbid8w0/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true\"]SEI form system[/ext-link]. We will then analyse this collected data in order to further detail and substantiate the effects that are induced at specific dosage ranges, their levels of intensity, style variations, and approximate frequency of occurrence.[/p]\n\n[p]DXM is a [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative hallucinogen[/int-link] within the morphinan chemical class. It is widely available for purchase at many pharmacies throughout the world in the form of cough syrup and tablets. The substance itself induces dissociative anaesthesia alongside significantly more psychedelic effects than that of other more traditional dissociatives, such as ketamine, PCP, and MXE. As this article will exclusively focus on this compound's subjective effects, if you would like to learn more about DXM's chemistry, pharmacology, history, legality, and potential dangers, then please see its PsychonautWiki article [ext-link to=\"https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM\"]here[/ext-link].[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Duration[/h2]\n\n[markdown text=\"**Total :** 8 - 12 hours* \n**Onset :** 30 - 120 minutes* \n**Come up :** 60 - 120 minutes* \n**Peak :** 3 - 6 hours* \n**Offset :** 2 - 4 hours* \n**After effects :** 4 - 24 hours\" /]\n[p]It is extremely important to note that the duration listed above applies to only the majority of people as DXM is metabolised through the CYP2D6 enzyme which has significantly reduced activity in approximately 10% of the population. This means that for certain individuals, DXM may be metabolised much more slowly than average in a manner which can result in a duration of up to 18-48 hours alongside of greatly increased uncomfortable side effects such as overstimulation and itchiness. This article assumes that the person ingesting DXM has a more normally functioning CYP2D6 enzyme.[/p]\n\n[p]The duration of DXM trips can also often be felt to be split into four separate phases which feel subjectively different from one another. The [i]first[/i] phase occurs while the user is still coming up on the substance. It typically consists of progressively more intense feelings of nausea and dissociative effects which culminate at the start of the peak with either vomiting and/or significantly reduced nausea. This nausea increases in its intensity proportional to the dosage consumed and is considerably more prevalent under the influence of DXM that comes in the form of cough syrup as opposed to pure powder or pills.[/p]\n\n[p]The [i]second phase[/i] lasts throughout the duration of the peak and can be described as feeling close to that of a traditional dissociative with a range of disconnective effects and cognitive suppressions. However, during the offset, the effects shift into the substances third phase in a manner which feels significantly more psychedelic, with an increase in high-level geometry, dream-like internal hallucinations, introspective thought patterns, and profound feelings of increased spirituality.[/p]\n\n[p]The final phase occurs during the day after the experience, once the user has slept. Depending on the individual's neurochemistry, it typically consists of either an afterglow or a hangover, with the afterglow feeling like an increase in energy, mania, mood elevation, and physical euphoria. This typically wears off approximately half way through the day and subsides into a general sense of sleepiness and lethargy. However, if the person is more prone to a hangover or has taken an overly heavy dosage, then they will likely experience feelings of lethargy, anxiety, inattentiveness, and mild depression. This will usually subside before the end of the day but may last multiple days in extreme cases.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Intensity scale[/h2]\n\n[p]This intensity scale breaks the subjective effects of DXM into seven distinct levels, in which each tier typically contains an expanding list of effects. These effects intensity proportionally to the dosage consumed. The approximate frequency of occurrence is also listed alongside each effect. For an explanation of the terms used within this frequency measuring system, please see the article [int-link to=\"/articles/approximate-frequency-of-occurrence-scale\"]here[/int-link]. Furthermore, it is important to note that the dosages provided here are average measurements that are comparable to recommendations made by [ext-link to=\"https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM\"]PsychonautWiki[/ext-link] and [ext-link to=\"https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_dose.shtml\"]Erowid[/ext-link]. The DXM dose required to reach a given range of effects seems to vary widely between individuals, depending on both body weight and neurochemistry. This variation in dosage sensitivity appears to be far more common among DXM users than almost any other hallucinogenic substance. For example, while some people may find themselves unusually sensitive to this compound, others will require a much higher dose than those recommended by this article and other reliable sources. It is therefore common for people within the psychonaut community to use [ext-link to=\"https://dxm.tripsit.me/\"]DXM calculators[/ext-link] which predict the required dosage depending on body weight. These dosage calculators usually refer to a 5 tier plateau system that was popularised in 2002 by [ext-link to=\"https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml\"]Erowid's DXM FAQ[/ext-link].[/p]\n\n[p]Although the levelling system documented on this page here is approximately—although not entirely—analogous to this plateau system, it is important to keep in mind that there are many subtle differences.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Subtle\" subHeader=\"(100 - 200 mg)\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n\nAt the lowest level, DXM frequently induces a small range of subtle [int-link to=\"/categories/cognitive-effects\"]cognitive effects[/int-link] which may be beneficial for enhancing a person's [int-link to=\"/effects/empathy-affection-and-sociability-enhancement\"]sociabilitity[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/stimulation\"]energy levels[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety-suppression\"]calmness[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/creativity-enhancement\"]creativity[/int-link]. \n\nThere may also be a sensation that the [int-link to=\"/effects/perception-of-bodily-lightness\"]body feels lighter[/int-link], resulting in a sense of bounciness and ease of movement. \nHowever, these changes may be difficult to distinguish between that of genuine alterations and the placebo effect, unless the person is already familiar with the substance. \nThis level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[ext-link to=\"https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.3\"]body feels lighter[/ext-link]\". \nThe specific subtle effects which generally occur at this level of intensity are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, listed below.\n\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[markdown text=\"* [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety-suppression\"]**Anxiety suppression**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/conceptual-thinking\"]**Conceptual thinking**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/creativity-enhancement\"]**Creativity enhancement**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/decreased-libido\"]**Increased libido**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/increased-sense-of-humor\"]**Increased sense of humor**[/int-link] <sup>(uncommon)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/novelty-enhancement\"]**Novelty enhancement**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/perception-of-bodily-lightness\"]**Perception of bodily lightness**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/stimulation\"]**Stimulation**[/int-link] <sup>(frequent)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/thought-acceleration\"]**Thought acceleration**[/int-link] <sup>(frequent)</sup>\" /]\n\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Mild\" subHeader=\"(200 - 400 mg)\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n\nAt this level, the effects of DXM can be generally described as a subtle dulling of the senses and a vague feeling of [int-link to=\"/effects/physical-disconnection\"]physical detachment[/int-link] from the external environment, which is accompanied by a distinct sense of [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-euphoria\"]mood elevation[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/empathy-affection-and-sociability-enhancement\"]physical detachment[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/stimulation\"]stimulation[/int-link]. \n\nThe [int-link to=\"/effects/empathy-affection-and-sociability-enhancement\"]sociability enhancement[/int-link] experienced at this dosage range is mildly entactogenic and can be described as forcibly induced feelings of love, empathy, and talkativeness. Although it is comparable in its style to the entactogenia induced by substances such as MDMA, it is much subtler in its intensity and forcefulness in a manner which is similar to that of 2C-B. \n\nHowever, this effect is usually only present at these lower levels of intensity as when the dosage is increased, it eventually gives way to more typical dissociative effects.These effects are accompanied by mild but pleasurable spontaneous tactile sensations which are commonly referred to as a \"body high.\" The specific details of which can be described through its [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations#style-variations\"]style variations[/int-link] as *moving in motion, sporadic in consistency, sharp in sensation, euphoric in pleasurableness, and often localised in its position to the hands, feet, or head*.At this point, the user may have to pay direct attention to the effects of the substance for them to be recognisable, or they may be noticeable but will not necessarily demand the user's attention.This level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[second plateau](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.4)\".  \n\nThe specific subtle effects that generally occur at this level of intensity are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, listed below.\n\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-suppression\"]markdown text=\"#### Sensory* [**Auditory suppression**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/tactile-suppression\"]**Tactile suppression**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/tracers\"]**Tracers**[/int-link] <sup>(level 1-2 / common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-acuity-suppression\"]**Visual acuity suppression**[/int-link] <sup>(frequent)</sup>\" /][int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety-suppression\"]markdown text=\"#### Cognitive* [**Anxiety suppression**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-euphoria\"]**Cognitive euphoria**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/creativity-enhancement\"]**Creativity enhancement**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/conceptual-thinking\"]**Conceptual thinking**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/empathy-affection-and-sociability-enhancement\"]**Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/increased-sense-of-humor\"]**Increased sense of humor**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/novelty-enhancement\"]**Novelty enhancement**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/thought-acceleration\"]**Thought acceleration**[/int-link] <sup>(frequent)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/increased-music-appreciation\"]**Increased music appreciation**[/int-link] <sup>(frequent)</sup>\" /][int-link to=\"/effects/appetite-suppression\"]markdown text=\"#### Physical* [**Appetite suppression**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/dehydration\"]**Dehydation**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/decreased-libido\"]**Increased libido**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/motor-control-loss\"]**Motor control loss**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/nausea\"]**Nausea**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>  * [int-link to=\"/effects/nausea?s=vomiting\"]**Vomiting**[/int-link] <sup>(uncommon)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]**Spontaneous tactile sensations**[/int-link]  <sup>(level ~1 / frequent)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/stimulation\"]**Stimulation**[/int-link] <sup>(frequent)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/perception-of-bodily-lightness\"]**Perception of bodily lightness**[/int-link] <sup>(common)</sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/pupil-dilation\"]**Pupil dilation**[/int-link] <sup>(uncommon)</sup>\" /]\n\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Moderate\" subHeader=\"(400 - 700 mg)\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the environment starts to feel physically further away in distance and increasingly disconnected from a person’s sensory perception. \n\nPartially blurred and double vision sets in, and anaesthetic-like effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/tactile-suppression\"]tactile numbness[/int-link] begin to take place. Other physical faculties such as [int-link to=\"/effects/motor-control-loss\"]motor control, coordination, and balance[/int-link] become somewhat suppressed in a manner that is partially compensated for by a feeling of the body being in a state of \"autopilot\". Interestingly enough, this suppression of motor control is unique in its style as it frequently results in users moving around in a [int-link to=\"/effects/gait-alteration\"]robotic and mechanical-like gait[/int-link] that does not seem to present itself under the influence of other dissociative substances. \n\nWithin the DXM community, this is colloquially referred to as a \"robo walk\".These physical effects are also accompanied by a pronounced feeling of [int-link to=\"/effects/sedation\"]bodily sedation[/int-link] that begins to overtake the [int-link to=\"/effects/stimulation\"]stimulation[/int-link] that is felt at lower dosages, and is accompanied by other [int-link to=\"/categories/cognitive-suppressions\"]cognitive suppressions[/int-link] such as [int-link to=\"/effects/thought-deceleration\"]thought deceleration[/int-link]. However, this sedation should not be confused with a sense of actual [int-link to=\"/effects/sleepiness\"]sleepiness[/int-link] as it is more comparable to feeling extremely heavy and unable to move one's body. Alongside of this, the user will likely feel a sense of persistent [int-link to=\"/effects/dry-mouth\"]dry mouth[/int-link] or [int-link to=\"/effects/dehydration\"]mild dehydration[/int-link] that often requires periodic sipping of water to keep it from reaching significant levels of discomfort.Various adverse effects such as itching and rashes may also occur at this dosage range and above. \n\nAlthough it is uncommon, it is worth noting that a certain percentage of people seem to experience [int-link to=\"/effects/itchiness\"]itchiness[/int-link] on DXM that is comparable to that which occurs on opioids such morphine, kratom, and heroin. This is colloquially referred to as a \"robo itch\" within the DXM community and is likely a result of histamine release. In terms of auditory perception, the clarity of sound itself may seem as if it has become [int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-suppression\"]vague, muffled, and distant[/int-link]. Nonetheless, one's sense of [int-link to=\"/effects/increased-music-appreciation\"]music appreciation[/int-link] will have profoundly increased.  Regarding visual effects, some inconsistent and brief distortions may also occur spontaneously during dissociative experiences. \n\nThese distortions can include alterations in perceived distances between objects, visual segmentation of one's vision into glitch-like [int-link to=\"/effects/environmental-cubism\"]cubes[/int-link] or [int-link to=\"/effects/scenery-slicing\"]slices[/int-link], and changes to the perceived size of one's body or the environment.During this level, if one allows themselves to relax while closing their eyes, they may find that they are fleetingly and partially drifting off into a [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]darkened hallucinatory void[/int-link] filled with vague [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]psychedelic geometry[/int-link] alongside simplistic [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures\"]shapes, forms, and structures[/int-link]. \n\nThis is usually a very brief and indistinct experience, which can quickly be interrupted by external stimuli such as noises or other distractions.With DXM in particular, it is worth noting that its [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] is typically much more distinct, colourful, pronounced, and psychedelic-esque in comparison to that of other more commonly used dissociatives. Although it does not usually extend beyond level 5 geometry and is not entirely on par with a typical psychedelic in terms of complexity, it can often come very close in terms of its intensity, colour palette, and vividness. This effect will typically begin to manifest at this level subtly, and its intensity increases proportional to the dosage consumed. It can be comprehensively described through its [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry#style-variations\"]style variations[/int-link] as *intricate in complexity, algorithmic in style, unstructured in organization, brightly lit in lighting, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, small in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity*.There is also a distinct possibility that the user may experience stereotypical psychedelic drifting which causes the environment to appear to warp, morph, bend, and flow. However, although this effect is more common on DXM in comparison to that of other more common dissociatives, it is still substantially less common in comparison to that of a traditional psychedelic. The [int-link to=\"/effects/drifting#style-variations\"]style variations of this drifting[/int-link] are simple in complexity, slow-moving, smooth in perceived framerate, constant throughout, and unrealistic in its appearance.Depending on the person's level of experience with this substance, these effects can be allowed to occupy a predominant role within the person's perception, or they may be partially ignored and made somewhat secondary to other chosen activities.This level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[third plateau](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.7)\".

disconnection[/int-link] has begun to completely block out the user's perception of the external environment. It is here where the person may find themselves undergoing an out-of-body experience as they float in a variety of directions and orientations through a \"[int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]dissociative hole[/int-link]\", which can be described as an expansive darkened void containing a wide array of [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures\"]structures[/int-link]. These structures are usually formed from solid materials which can take the form of any shape. Common examples include *vast and monolithic pillars, columns, walls, tunnels, blocks, buildings, slides, monuments, wheels, pyramids, caverns, and a variety of abstract or fractal shapes*. The internal hallucinations that occur at this level will usually consist of vivid, ever-changing dream-like scenes and imagery. They can be comprehensively described through their [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination#style-variations\"]style variations[/int-link] as a combination of *lucid and delirious in awareness, fixed in style, primarily novel experiences over everyday or biographical content, autonomous in interactivity, and with a combination of both realistic and geometry based visual styles*.Although they are substantially less common than [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link] can also occasionally occur at heavy dosages of DXM. These are typically deliriant-like in nature and consist of solid hallucinations of objects or people blending seamlessly into the external environment. The most common theme seems to be the hallucination of conversing with other people in the environment who were not actually present throughout the trip. However, it is important to note that despite this effect being more common under the influence of DXM in comparison to that of other dissociatives, it is still quite rare and may never be experienced even by regular users.Alongside these disconnective hallucinatory effects, the user may experience feelings of altered cognition that feel as if they direct one's thought stream towards topics of [int-link to=\"/effects/introspection\"]introspection[/int-link], an [int-link to=\"/effects/analysis-enhancement\"]analysis of the details of their life[/int-link], and a general sense of [int-link to=\"/effects/spirituality-enhancement\"]spiritual or philosophical contemplation[/int-link].This is the level at which the effects become powerful enough to render the person undergoing them as [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]incapable of functioning, interacting normally, or thinking in a sober manner[/int-link]. At this level, the effects of the substance are apparent and can no longer be ignored in any capacity, leaving the user entirely engaged in the experience whether they wish to be or not. In terms of how this looks from an outsiders perspective, the person will usually appear to be either heavily sedated or almost entirely unconscious.This level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to the lower end of a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[fourth plateau](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.7)\".

to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]feeling of selfhood[/int-link] to cease functioning. This leads into a state which is commonly referred to as \"[int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link]\" due to the way in which the person completely loses their ability to recall and comprehend their own sense of identity.This state of ego loss is accompanied by extremely [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]vivid hallucinatory voids[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures\"]structures[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometric forms[/int-link], sensory disconnection, [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link], and occasionally life-changing spiritual or [int-link to=\"/categories/transpersonal-states\"]transpersonal experiences[/int-link].  It is worth noting that during this dosage range, feelings of sudden [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety\"]anxiety[/int-link], panic, or even an impending sense of doom can spontaneously occur at any point throughout the trip for no discernible reason. Although this is relatively uncommon, it can occur regardless of the users level of experience and can even suddenly manifest during the offset of the drug when the person has begun to feel almost entirely sober. This experience typically lasts any where from thirty minutes to a couple of hours, and seems more likely to manifest for people who use this substance on a regular basis.This level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to the upper end of a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[fourth plateau](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.7)\".

occurs when a person [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]loses all sensory awareness[/int-link] and semblance of normal cognitive functioning. This renders the person unconscious and consistently leaves extended gaps in a person’s memory with large periods of [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link] which are generally impossible to recall once the experience is over. It is at this level of dissociation that other dissociative substances such as ketamine are used in medical procedures for their anaesthetic effects.At this dosage range, the person will experience the effects typically associated with the previously described level during the onset and offset of their trip. During the peak, however, they will black out and become unconscious for a prolonged period of time that is directly proportional to the dosage consumed.Although this extreme dissociative state may be attractive to certain individuals, it is worth noting that this level of intensity is not only potentially dangerous but also less therapeutic and exploratory than the previous levels. With DXM in particular, it is said by sites such as [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_dose.shtml) that dosages between 2,500 mg and 20,000 mg are capable of resulting in death. However, this seems unusually high to me, and I would not personally be surprised if dosages closer to 1000mg were capable of causing a fatal overdose within certain individuals that have either a lower body weight or a higher sensitivity.[/headered-textbox][headered-textbox label=\"Level 7\" header=\"Prolonged\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]This state of DXM is not necessarily the highest level of the substances potential intensity but is qualitatively different from that of the previously listed levels. This state is induced by taking successive doses of DXM over several hours, instead of a single dose. It is reported to intensify many aspects of the DXM experience, and often produces more vivid and disorientating [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entity[/int-link] contact, [int-link to=\"/effects/delirium\"]delirium[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety\"]anxiety[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/psychosis\"]psychosis[/int-link] and many other extremely unpleasant side effects. Within the DXM community it is colloquially referred to as \"plateau sigma\" and was originally described in Erowid's 2002 [DXM FAQ](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.9). It is usually achieved using the following technique:1. Take a weak \"second plateau\" dosage at approximately 200-400 mg. It is recommended to do this earlier in the day due to the lengthiness of this process, as sleep deprivation or fatigue can negatively impact the experience.2. After approximately three hours (or about one hour after the peak) take another weak \"second plateau\" dosage.3. After another three hours (or about one hour after the second peak) take either a strong \"second plateau\" or a weak \"third plateau\" dosage at approximately 400-600mg.4. During the offset of this third dosage, the user may find themselves experiencing \"plateau sigma\" instead of slowly returning to baseline.However, it is important to note that within the DXM community, this experience is widely considered extremely unpleasant and potentially dangerous. There are seemingly very few cases of people who enjoy this state of mind. Because of these factors, it is universally advised that people avoid experimenting with it altogether.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[markdown text=\"### Experience reports\" /]Anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our experience index include:[int-link to=\"/reports/re-discovering-dxm\"]markdown text=\"- [**Re-discovering DXM**[/int-link] by [int-link to=\"/profiles/Josie\"]*Josie Kins*[/int-link]- [int-link to=\"/reports/heavy-dose-of-cough-syrup\"]**Heavy dose of cough syrup**[/int-link] by *Gabriel*\" /]\n\n[h2]Personal commentary[/h2]\n[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"]In my opinion, DXM is tragically overlooked and underrated by the mainstream psychonaut community. It is easily one of my favourite hallucinogens, as for me personally, it induces therapeutic introspection alongside profound feelings of spirituality enhancement in a manner that is more consistent than almost any of the other 120+ substances which I am experienced with. In fact, the only other hallucinogenic substance which is as consistently equal to me in this regard is ayahuasca.However, it is worth noting that I very much seem to be an outlier when it comes this. Over the years I have witnessed many other people under the influence of DXM, and while they usually hold it in high regard, only a small fraction of them seem to benefit from its effects to quite the same extent that I do. However, in an attempt to diminish my bias as much as possible, I have been sure to take this into account within the documentation above.I suspect the reason that I benefit from DXM so much stems from a combination of having a compatible physiology, as well the way in which its unique effect profile results in a trip which is seemingly 75% dissociative and 25% psychedelic — allowing me to simultaneously experience the positive aspects of both hallucinogenic classes, all within a single compound. I usually find that the first two-thirds of the experience is primarily dissociative in its effects with the last third being primarily psychedelic, with a headspace that also changes into something reminiscent of tryptamines. It's during this latter phase in which I typically undergo the aforementioned feelings of therapeutic introspection combined with a sense of profound and contemplative spiritual reverence towards my place within this universe.For many people, DXM seems to have a reputation of being a \"kiddie drug\" that presumably stems from a number of factors. For example, its ease of availability results in young teenagers commonly using or abusing this substance when they cannot access anything else. In addition to this, approximately 10% of users cannot metabolise it correctly which likely results in them reporting disproportionately adverse side effects that people fail to realise will not occur for the majority of the population. It is also commonly taken in the form of cough syrup which many people are understandably apprehensive about ingesting while remaining unaware that is also commonly available in other forms. Despite this reputation, however, DXM is an incredibly powerful hallucinogen that can potentially offer as much depth to it as any of the other classical dissociatives or hallucinogens. It's because of this that I would highly recommend any budding psychonaut to consider either revisiting this compound or giving it an honest try if they have yet to do so.[/quote]\n\n",

This experience typically lasts any where from thirty minutes to a couple of hours, and seems more likely to manifest for people who use this substance on a regular basis.This level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to the upper end of a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[fourth plateau](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.7)\".

It is at this level of dissociation that other dissociative substances such as ketamine are used in medical procedures for their anaesthetic effects.At this dosage range, the person will experience the effects typically associated with the previously described level during the onset and offset of their trip. During the peak, however, they will black out and become unconscious for a prolonged period of time that is directly proportional to the dosage consumed.Although this extreme dissociative state may be attractive to certain individuals, it is worth noting that this level of intensity is not only potentially dangerous but also less therapeutic and exploratory than the previous levels. With DXM in particular, it is said by sites such as [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_dose.shtml) that dosages between 2,500 mg and 20,000 mg are capable of resulting in death. However, this seems unusually high to me, and I would not personally be surprised if dosages closer to 1000mg were capable of causing a fatal overdose within certain individuals that have either a lower body weight or a higher sensitivity."

Within the DXM community it is colloquially referred to as \"plateau sigma\" and was originally described in Erowid's 2002 [DXM FAQ](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.9). It is usually achieved using the following technique:1. Take a weak \"second plateau\" dosage at approximately 200-400 mg. It is recommended to do this earlier in the day due to the lengthiness of this process, as sleep deprivation or fatigue can negatively impact the experience.2. After approximately three hours (or about one hour after the peak) take another weak \"second plateau\" dosage.3. After another three hours (or about one hour after the second peak) take either a strong \"second plateau\" or a weak \"third plateau\" dosage at approximately 400-600mg.4. During the offset of this third dosage, the user may find themselves experiencing \"plateau sigma\" instead of slowly returning to baseline.However, it is important to note that within the DXM community, this experience is widely considered extremely unpleasant and potentially dangerous. There are seemingly very few cases of people who enjoy this state of mind. Because of these factors, it is universally advised that people avoid experimenting with it altogether."

            "In my opinion, DXM is tragically overlooked and underrated by the mainstream psychonaut community. It is easily one of my favourite hallucinogens, as for me personally, it induces therapeutic introspection alongside profound feelings of spirituality enhancement in a manner that is more consistent than almost any of the other 120+ substances which I am experienced with. In fact, the only other hallucinogenic substance which is as consistently equal to me in this regard is ayahuasca.However, it is worth noting that I very much seem to be an outlier when it comes this. Over the years I have witnessed many other people under the influence of DXM, and while they usually hold it in high regard, only a small fraction of them seem to benefit from its effects to quite the same extent that I do. However, in an attempt to diminish my bias as much as possible, I have been sure to take this into account within the documentation above.I suspect the reason that I benefit from DXM so much stems from a combination of having a compatible physiology, as well the way in which its unique effect profile results in a trip which is seemingly 75% dissociative and 25% psychedelic — allowing me to simultaneously experience the positive aspects of both hallucinogenic classes, all within a single compound. I usually find that the first two-thirds of the experience is primarily dissociative in its effects with the last third being primarily psychedelic, with a headspace that also changes into something reminiscent of tryptamines. It's during this latter phase in which I typically undergo the aforementioned feelings of therapeutic introspection combined with a sense of profound and contemplative spiritual reverence towards my place within this universe.For many people, DXM seems to have a reputation of being a \"kiddie drug\" that presumably stems from a number of factors. For example, its ease of availability results in young teenagers commonly using or abusing this substance when they cannot access anything else. In addition to this, approximately 10% of users cannot metabolise it correctly which likely results in them reporting disproportionately adverse side effects that people fail to realise will not occur for the majority of the population. It is also commonly taken in the form of cough syrup which many people are understandably apprehensive about ingesting while remaining unaware that is also commonly available in other forms. Despite this reputation, however, DXM is an incredibly powerful hallucinogen that can potentially offer as much depth to it as any of the other classical dissociatives or hallucinogens. It's because of this that I would highly recommend any budding psychonaut to consider either revisiting this compound or giving it an honest try if they have yet to do so."

The absence of such terminology has limited our ability to fully understand our own experiences and made discussion and research in this domain difficult. People who have noticed this absence have been driven to volunteer countless hours of their free time to document their experiences and coin, define, and categorize terms, ultimately culminating in the Subjective Effect Index.[/p] \n\n[p]Effect Index is the website that hosts the [ext-link to=\"https://www.effectindex.com/effects\"]Subjective Effect Index[/ext-link] (SEI), a database of 233 effect descriptions that strives to serve as a comprehensive map of all potential experiences that can occur under the influence of any class of psychoactive compound, particularly hallucinogens. The existing SEI has been increasingly used to facilitate discussion within online psychedelic spaces since around 2012. However, it has not yet reached a level of completeness and polish that would allow it to serve as a universal terminology set. By improving and completing the SEI, we intend to create a tool that will improve our collective ability to research altered states of consciousness and greatly enhance the academic, clinical, therapeutic, personal, and cultural relevance of psychoactive compounds.[/p]\n\n[p]Under the employment of [ext-link to=\"https://www.mindstate.design/\"]Mindstate Design Labs[/ext-link], a Y Combinator startup, I am leading a project to develop a new version of the SEI with unparalleled comprehensiveness and academic rigor. Prominent scientific researchers such as [ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_S._Ray\"]Thomas S. Ray[/ext-link], [ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_B._Newberg\"]Andrew B. Newburg[/ext-link], and to a lesser extent [ext-link to=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.carhart-harris\"]Robin Carhart-Harris [/ext-link] are serving as advisors throughout the index's development, and it will be published as a publicly available open source research paper.[/p]\n\n[p]This project will greatly improve the overarching organisational structure of the Index and more than double the number of distinct defined effects. It will incorporate a comprehensive literature review of other rudimentary altered state of consciousness ontologies, such as psychometric tools and informal classification systems found within books and online resources. We intend for this project to be fully open source so that it can become a ubiquitous resource analogous to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, providing a defined common lexicon so that researchers and laypeople alike can discuss altered states of consciousness in a succinct yet meaningful way.[/p]\n\n[p]Thanks to my employers, the creation of this particular aspect of the project is already underway. However, new funding will be needed to integrate the improved SEI into the Effect Index website and empower the Subjective Effect Documentation community to continue improving the index in our ever-evolving world. This document details what we still need to bring Effect Index to its full potential as a global source of subjective effect knowledge and discovery.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[headered-textbox header=\"Web Development\" subHeader=\"($28,053 - $30,000)\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]My biggest priority for this project right now is improving the infrastructure behind our website. The existing website has evolved over time through the generous contributions of multiple community volunteers, but it is presently not able to accommodate any significant changes to the overall structure of the content. While we have an excellent starting point, there are a number of important features and improvements that will need to be implemented to turn this project into a platform capable of serving as a dedicated community resource for establishing, showcasing, and progressing the field of Subjective Effect Documentation.[/p]\n\n[p]To maintain and implement improvements to the website, I would need to contract with a single freelance web developer, preferably on a long-term basis. My first choice for this role is a specific prominent community member who is highly capable, passionate about the project's goals, has an in-depth understanding of this project, is familiar with the website's backend code, and has been helping us work on it for a number of years.[/p]\n\n[p]For in-depth details on each aspect of this, feel free to look at our spreadsheet [ext-link to=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAqiUgjzsbaZVaSJRJLKkWJ40Rug3QmL13fTE02Cw-M/edit?usp=sharing\"]here[/ext-link]. Otherwise, we have included a summarised list of our specific goals below.[/p]\n\n[ul listStyle=\"circle\"]\n[li][i]User interface and profile improvements:[/i] Better, more customizable user profiles would facilitate writers, artists, replicators, and other people involved in our project to showcase their contributions and general online presence, therefore encouraging higher quality community contributions. We would like to implement:\n[ul listStyle=\"square\"]\n[li]A way to change the order of replications on user pages so that they are better suited for use as portfolios.[/li]\n[li]A way to better manage the categories of user pages, and the order of the users in them.[/li]\n[li]Simplified trip report submission to our report index. Reports would then undergo moderation and manual approval before being integrated into the Subjective Effect Index via the effect tagging process.[/li]\n[li]Upgrading the user interface to allow direct upload of images, videos, gifs, and audio files without resorting to an external FTP client. This would allow replicators and visionary artists to submit their own content easily to relevant effect pages and prevent changes in third-party services from disabling community assets.[/li]\n[li]Upgrading the trip report editor to fix numerous issues to make writing trip reports easier, as well as making trip reports easier for machine learning to process and reliably analyze. These changes include the input fields needing to be more strict with the values they accept, as well as converting between units for the user. The medications list should also be a separate list of meds and dosages, similar to how the substances box works. A more consistent time format would help with readability and ML processing. The editor should also strip whitespace around input fields.[/li]\n[li]A live preview for the VCode editor would be immensely helpful, especially for large content and formatting-dense articles.[/li]\n[li]These changes would take an estimated 190 hours to add (~$5130 USD).[/li][/ul][/li]\n\n[li][i]Structural improvements:[/i] To remain a relevant resource, the website should be upgraded to accommodate the following:\n[ul listStyle=\"square\"]\n[li]The newest edition of the Subjective Effect Index is being developed under Josie Kins’ work with Mind State Design Labs, and we should have the website fully prepared for the new effects and general overarching structure of the ontology by the time it is published and available to the public.[/li]\n[li]A directory of other Altered State of Consciousness Ontologies, with direct comparison to the Subjective Index. This will essentially be a user-facing showcase of the literature review that Josikinz is already working on with Mind State Design Labs.[/li]\n[li]These changes would take an estimated 180 hours to add (~$4860 USD).[/li][/ul][/li]\n\n[li]Ideally as many pages outside of effects, articles, etc, should be editable within the UI of the website to the maximum extent that is practically possible. This will take inspiration from the way in which MediaWiki allows people to do much the same thing.\n[ul listStyle=\"square\"]\n[li]We’ll need to make embeddable vcode components for a wider array of site features: tabs, read more button, tabs for viewing multiple versions of an article or article section\nallow creation / editing of arbitrary pages with vcode[/li]\n[li]changing an article's icon in the web editor[/li]\n[li]We need version control for articles, much like with MediaWiki. This would allow us to track edits and revert changes more easily. Something which is essential for giving people more editor privileges.\n[li]These changes would take an estimated 160 hours to add (~$4320 USD).[/li][/li][/ul][/li]\n\n[li]A function for redirecting effects to other effects or webpages, so you create an effect that essentially serves an alternative title which people may search for. (~10h / $270)[/li]\n[li]Implement timestamps into the error log.[/li]\n[li]Automatic citation generation in a set format would make managing citations easier, as well as preferring DOIs. (~20h / $540)[/li]\n[li]Some things such as the “project” tab could have a scrolling TOC on the side? Discuss. (~30h / $810)[/li]\n[li]The “About Us” button on the page only displays after hitting “read more”. Most people probably won’t click “read more”. This is a small thing but should absolutely be fixed.[/li]\n[li]Implementing analytics to see what pages people interact with / how they interact with them (eg, what elements are clicked the most?) would be helpful when designing articles to see which elements convey information better, and so on. (~50h / $1350)[/li]\n[li]A discord bot to post updates / help manage the EI (eg, when someone submits a new trip report).  (~20h / $540)[/li]\n[li] The main page should be overhauled with new information and content, as well as phrasing such as “Hallucinogenic substance classes” being updated to use modern language. (~15h / $405)[/li]\n[li]A way to search through all articles / vcode components for text, to aide in updating content and fixing references to broken components. (~30h / $810)[/li]\n[li]Proper error handling and status codes from the API, instead of returning 500 for everything. (~30h / $810)[/li]\n[li]Embeddable gif support in the image viewer. (~15h / $405)[/li]\n[li]Articles that were published before the publish date system was added are missing a publish date. Adding a box to manually enter a date would be ideal. (~5h / $135)[/li]\n[/ul]\n[ul listStyle=\"circle\"]\n[li][i]Article and report editing improvements:[/i] We would like to implement various goals in order to make the creation and editing of content on the Effect Index easier and faster for editors.[/li]\n[ul listStyle=\"square\"]\n[li]Article formatting templates, to make creating standardised articles easier. (~15h / $675)[/li]\n[li]Fixing bugs and issues with the editor, such as visual issues with regards to account permissions. (~11h / $297)[/li]\n[li]A live preview for the VCode editor, and showing the article side-by-side instead of a tabbed view would make editing formatting easier.[/li]\n[li]A component for showing substance durations and dosages would be nice to have, when referencing a specific substance.[/li]\n[li]Inline citation links would be great (similar to mediawiki). The current css for them should also be more aesthetically pleasing. Currently the citations are too big and with too much space around them. (~30h / $810)[/li]\n[li]Overhaul the replication gallery. I would prefer to have not just the option for slideshows, but collections of tiled thumbnails for a more presentable showcasing. (~60h / $1620)[/li]\n[li]Tickboxes for managing profile roles, and managing effect tags rather than freestanding boxes would make site management easier. (~11h / $297)[/li]\n[/ul][/ul][/headered-textbox]\n[hr /]\n\n[p]Depending on the number of features we are implementing and at an hourly rate of $27, we estimate that this platform overhaul would cost $30,000 to fully implement.

Although it is true that DMT is found in trace amounts within a vast number of plants and animals (including humans), there is absolutely no evidence that it is specifically produced by the pineal gland or that it is released in psychedelic amounts during certain situations. In fact, the current scientific consensus regarding the prevalence of DMT within plants and animals seems to suggest that it is most likely a byproduct of biological processes that are entirely unrelated to that of the pineal gland."

Alongside of this, the amnesia that is commonly experienced during the offset of a DMT experience behaves identically to that of the amnesia which is frequently experienced after waking up from a dream. Last of all and in a more subjective sense, the general feeling of a DMT hallucination feels very dreamlike to me and is commonly described as such by many people."

For example, the simultaneous experience of psychedelic geometry during a hallucinatory state seems to result in it appearing to be physically comprised of ever-shifting and incomprehensibly complex condensed geometric forms in a manner which gives them their well known \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. In terms of their behaviour, however, the simultaneous experience of an incredibly wide range of cognitive states such as ego death and various transpersonal effects seem to synergise and interplay with the specific effect of internal hallucinations in a manner which results in them displaying themes and concepts which would not ordinarily occur during normal dream states."

From his perspective, McKenna hypothesised that the DMT was potentially an access point to a parallel universe, a tool through which extraterrestrials use to communicate with us, a space in which human beings from the future reside, or an afterlife which contains an \"ecology of souls\" of previously living and unborn ancestral spirits."

In this video, I'm going to describe and discuss the subjective effect profile of Dimethyltryptamine or DMT from the perspective of the Subjective Effect Index. This is an incredibly profound and transformative experience that most commonly occurs under the influence of heavy dosages of psychedelic, dissociative, dysdelic, and deliriant compounds.[/p] \n\n[p]DMT is a smokable [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/visual\"]psychedelic hallucinogen[/int-link] within the tryptamine chemical class. It is also found as a naturally occurring endogenous byproduct within a huge variety of plants and animals, [ext-link to=\"https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/dta.422\"]including humans[/ext-link]. The substance itself induces a brief but extremely intense psychedelic experience, alongside a disproportionate amount of hallucinatory content in comparison to other traditional psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, and mescaline.[/p]\n\n[p]This videdo exclusively discusses DMT’s subjective effects. If you would like to learn more about DMT's chemistry, pharmacology, history, legality, and potential dangers, refer to its dedicated article on psychonautwiki.[/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Durational stages[/h2]\n[ul]\n[li][b]Total :[/b] 5 - 20 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Onset :[/b] 20 - 40 seconds[/li]\n[li][b]Come up :[/b] 1 - 3 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Peak :[/b] 2 - 8 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Offset :[/b] 1 - 6 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]After effects :[/b] 10 - 60 minutes[/li]\n[/ul]\n[p]Within around 5-20 minutes, the progression of a DMT trip seems to progress through four separate stages of experience that each feel distinct from one another. At heavy dosages the user may find themselves progressing through all of these stages in sequence, while low-dose experiences may skip over stages 2 or 3. I will define and describe these stages now.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Taking off\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"chart-line.svg\"]\n[p]The first stage of a DMT trip is the onset, which leads into what is commonly referred to as \"breaking through\".[/p]\n\n[p]As the user smokes DMT, effects typically begins with the sudden onset of distinct [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-enhancements\"]visual enhancements[/int-link], which are immediately followed by high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] and a [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]warm tingling sensation across the skin[/int-link]. At higher dosages, the user may find the pipe that they are using to smoke their DMT has transformed into an incomprehensible mass of geometry that is quite difficult to put down or hand off to someone nearby. There may also be [int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-hallucination\"]auditory hallucinations[/int-link] that resemble soft crackling. For example, some users report an extended tone that quickly rises in volume and pitch as the intensity of [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-effects\"]visual effects[/int-link] also increases.[/p]\n\n[p]When it does occur, this sound typically becomes all-enveloping and abruptly ends as one of several different “take off” variations are experienced. Which include, but are not limited to:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li]Increasingly intense [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link], which becomes so all-enveloping that the visible environment is completely blocked out and replaced.[/li]\n[li]Feelings of being suddenly pushed through – and onto – the other side of a membrane.[/li]\n[li]The environment forming into a geometry-filled tunnel, which the user moves into as it widens and subsequently encompasses their entire vision.[/li]\n[li]The environment splitting into separated sections, leaving a gaping chasm filled with high-level geometry as the user separates from their body and is then catapulted directly into it at a high speed.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]This process of \"taking off\" typically occurs within the range of about 30 seconds to a minute, and leads directly onto the second stage of a DMT trip.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 2\" header=\"The Waiting Room\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"hourglass.svg\"]\n[p]Almost immediately after a person has smoked enough DMT to “[i]take off[/i]”, they sometimes find themselves spending approximately 10 - 30 seconds in what is often described as a psychedelic “[i]waiting room[/i]”. It can take on any appearance, but most commonly presents itself as a tunnel, room, or space that is comprised of fast moving [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]In fact, this \"waiting room\" feels distinctively different from the main bulk of the trip to such an extent that it has led many DMT users to speculate that it is potentially some sort of psychedelic loading screen, during which the upcoming trip is being generated and planned out by the subconscious mind.[/p]\n\n[p]After “taking off”, the person will usually transition into the most impressive stage of the experience. However, in certain cases the user may feel stuck within the waiting room, and may even experience hallucinatory [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] suggesting that they are not yet ready to proceed past it. It's also important to note that although still relatively common in its occurrence, the waiting room is the least consistent stage of a DMT trip, and many users will never experience it at all, while simply finding that their DMT trips skip over it instead.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 3\" header=\"The Other Side\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"geometry.svg\"]\n[p]Once the waiting room stage is either finished or skipped over, the user will feel that they have broken through into what is commonly referred to as the \"other side\". It is here where an incredibly wide variety of potential hallucinatory content can manifest itself. However, this intensified stage will still usually follow somewhat consistent themes and archetypes that are reported by many people who experience the substance.[/p]\n\n[p]These themes generally consist of visiting a hallucinated alternate reality that is often said to feel \"more real\" than everyday life. In terms of their visual aesthetic, these hallucinatory spaces usually consist of incomprehensibly complex psychedelic [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] that is condensed into [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]settings or scenes[/int-link]. Examples of DMT spaces include landscapes, fractalscapes, rooms, buildings, cities, tunnels, caverns, non-euclidean structures resembling a hive or nest, womb-like environments, and an infinite variety of potential others.[/p]\n\n[p]Within DMT spaces, there are often one or more [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link] within the user's perceived field of vision. These entities frequently act as if they have been waiting for the user's arrival, and are usually unphased by the person's sudden apparition. Upon noticing the user, DMT entities may enthusiastically greet them, but reactions of surprise, indifference, or ambivalence are also equally common. These entities may also convey a sense of urgency, as though attempting to demonstrate a multitude of incredible things during the short amount of time that they have before the effects of the drug wear off.[/p]\n\n[p]During these experiences, [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]hallucinatory entities[/int-link] may employ a variety of [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity?s=communication-styles\"]communnication styles[/int-link], including: [i]spoken language, direct manipulation of the visual environment, choreographed movement, telepathy, beams of energy or information, visual languages, or any combination of these[/i]. Through means such as these, entities often seemingly attempt to either explain some message to the user, or provide a guided tour of some aspect of the [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link] which they inhabit. The message often feels personalized and related to the user's life or emotional well-being, but can also contain aspects that seem entirely nonsensical or ineffable when removed from the context of the DMT trip.[/p]\n\n[p]These [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] will often dubiously present themselves as all-knowing, and although they can take any visual form, some visual archetypes are more commonly experienced, including: [i]humanoids, aliens, elves, insectoids, giant spheres, beings of light, plants, jesters, maternal or nurturing guardians, and complex robotic machines[/i]. At this point it is common for the user (unless they are very experienced) to be completely overwhelmed by the DMT trip, despite it also often feeling relatively clear-headed. This sometimes results in the entities encouraging the user to stay calm, to not give into astonishment, and to simply try to pay attention to what is happening.[/p]\n\n[p]Although they are common, it is worth noting that these [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entity[/int-link]-filled [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]hallucinatory spaces[/int-link] do not necessarily occur for every person and are not entirely consistent in their manifestation between trips. A certain number of people do not seem to experience hallucinations at all, and instead simply find themselves engulfed in all-encompassing high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] during this stage of the DMT trip. Thus, the frequency with which any given user encounters entity-filled DMT spaces varies.[/p]\n\n[p]After 2 - 10 minutes of this experience, the DMT trip will begin to wear off while moving into its fourth and final stage.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 4\" header=\"Coming Down\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"chart-line-down.svg\"]\n[p]The final stage concludes the trip, with either the sensation of being pulled progressively further away from the [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link], or the hallucinations becoming increasingly vague and ill-defined until imperceptible. During this process, the [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] will sometimes bid farewell and encourage the person to return if given the chance.[/p]\n\n[p]Once over, the user immediately finds themselves back in reality with strong level 4 - 5 visual [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] which quickly fades. Similar to how the content of a dream is commonly forgotten upon waking up, detailed memories of DMT experiences also often rapidly deteriorate upon returning to baseline consciousness. This [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link] can be counteracted by taking notes, recounting the trip to another person in detail, recording a narration of the experience on audio or video, or using other such method.[/p]\n\n[p]As the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] becomes more mild and [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link] sets in, the user will often experience a sense of being [int-link to=\"/effects/physical-euphoria\"]bathed in euphoria and awe[/int-link]. The geometry typically persists for an additional 5 - 10 minutes before disappearing completely, leaving a strong [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]body high[/int-link] that can persist for up to half an hour in extreme cases. This afterglow typically feels like a warm fuzziness throughout the body, and often leaves behind a sense of cognitive [int-link to=\"/effects/rejuvenation\"]rejuvenation[/int-link], well-being, and mental clarity which can last for hours, days, or even weeks after the trip.[/p]\n\n[p]However, it is worth noting that if the user has consumed a dosage that is not strong enough to reach stages two and three, then this experience of coming down will simply manifest as a progressive reduction of intensity without any of the aforementioned effects or details.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n[h2]Intensity Scale[/h2]\n[p]Now that I've covered my model of durational stages, I would like to cover a generalised intensity scale that can be applied to the DMT experience as a whole.

At higher doses, this geometry is significantly more likely to result in states of [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-exposure-to-inner-mechanics-of-consciousness\"]visual exposure to the inner mechanics of consciousness[/int-link] rather than a [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-exposure-to-semantic-concept-network\"]visual exposure to one's semantic concept network[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]It is also worth noting that the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] induced by vaporized DMT is widely considered to be the most profoundly intricate and complex manifestation of this effect out of any and all psychedelic drugs. Compared to the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry?s=variations\"]style of geometry[/int-link] produced by ayahuasca, the geometry appears more synthetic and digital in material composition, it demonstrates colour schemes that are similar to those experienced on LSD, and has an organized geometric structure reminiscent of that produced by psilocybin.[/p]\n\n[p]At this level, spontaneous tactile sensations become pronounced and fully manifested. The [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations?s=variations\"]style variations of these bodily sensations[/int-link] includes [i]a constant duration, feelings of movement, gentle character, all-encompassing placement, and euphoric in pleasurability[/i].

The user typically feels like they have broken through into the hallucinatory [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link], as previously described in the \"[i]other side[/i]\" section of this video.[/p]\n\n[p]For most people, a strong dose of DMT will produce high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] more consistently than any other psychedelic. The style variations of these internal hallucinations is that they are usually [i]lucid in awareness, interactive, novel in subject, autonomous and non-controllable, and psychedelic in appearance[/i]. This is accompanied by other hallucinatory effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]sceneries and landscapes[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]narrative scenarios[/int-link]. These hallucinations can involve an endless variety of themes that may be personal, religious, spiritual, futuristic, magical, surreal, nonsensical, or transcendental in nature.[/p]\n\n[p]It's also worth mentioning that during the onset of this intensity range and above, the user will often experiences [int-link to=\"/effects/changes-in-felt-gravity\"]changes in their perception of gravity[/int-link] which commonly involve feelings of floating at extreme speeds either forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards, or in an unspecifiable direction. This will usually stop once the user has reached their \"destination\" but will often continue at a much slower pace if the hallucination involves moving around within a specific location.[/p]\n\n[p]Despite intense hallucinations at this dosage range, the user will often still feel partially connected to their physical body even while traversing [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]hallucinatory spaces[/int-link]. Most users will also automatically close their eyes and allow themselves to be immersed in the internal experience – however, if the user suddenly opens their eyes midway through the trip, they will likely leave the hallucinatory space. Upon interrupting their [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], the user will typically experience much less-intense [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-effects\"]visual effects[/int-link] with their eyes open. These effects typically include strong [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-distortions\"]visual distortions[/int-link] and highly complex [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] that almost completely cover the user's field of view. Upon closing their eyes again, the user may find themselves placed directly back into the same [int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]hallucinatory scenario[/int-link], or they may simply experience high-level geometry while being unable to completely re-enter their internal hallucination.[/p]\n\n[p]During less intense DMT breakthroughs experienced at this dosage range, many users report feeling surprisingly lucid and clear-headed in comparison to an equally-intense dose of psilocybin, mescaline, or LSD. However, the insightful and therapeutic cognitive effects that are heavily associated with psychedelic experiences are frequently either entirely absent or significantly reduced. This may be a result of DMT's extremely short duration, which does not allow the person much time to deeply contemplate or experience its cognitive effects.[/p]\n\nIf the user is inexperienced with psychedelic substances while undergoing this dosage range or above, they may find themselves experiencing [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety\"]anxiety[/int-link] and fear throughout the duration of the trip. This is not because DMT is inherently anxiety-inducing, but is more likely a response to being thrust into a profoundly complex, bizarre, overwhelming, and unfamiliar situation. As with any hallucinogen, it is always safest to slowly increase an inexperienced person's dosage in small increments over the course of multiple trips, and at a rate which the user is comfortable with. \n\n[p]A strong DMT experience is powerful enough to render the user mostly incapable of functioning normally, social interactions, or thinking in a sober manner. At this level of intensity, the effects of the substance are obvious and cannot be ignored in any capacity, leaving the user completely engaged in the experience whether they wish to be or not.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of its stages, a strong DMT trip will usually result in all four stages of the experience, but with the \"other side\" being distinctly present – although it will still become more defined at higher dosages.

characterised by a complete [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]loss of the user's sense of self or ego[/int-link]. The user not only feels as though they have broken through to the “[i]other side[/i]” of the [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link], but that they have also [int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression\"]lost any ability to recall[/int-link] and comprehend even the most fundamental concepts in their long-term memory. These concepts can include everything from their name, hometown, memories, the awareness of being on drugs, what drugs even are, what human beings are, what life is, that time exists, what anything is, or that anything exists.[/p]\n\n[p]During this state, the person will usually still experience typical hallucinatory content such as [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]scenery[/int-link], imagery, [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entity[/int-link] contact, etc. However, the hallucinations may become even further defined in terms of their visual clarity and overall complexity. Alongside this, the content of these hallucinations may be significantly more likely to adopt themes that are commonly interpreted as being \"otherworldly\", \"alien\", \"transcendent\", or from a \"higher plane of existence\".  On the contrary, many people also report that at this level their hallucinations do not become better defined, but instead break down and become increasingly fast-moving, formless, rapidly shapeshifting, and incoherent.[/p]\n\n[p]In regards to the person's cognition and general state of mind at this level, there is a much higher likelihood of intense [int-link to=\"/categories/transpersonal-effects\"]transpersonal states[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/spirituality-enhancement\"]spirituality enhancement[/int-link]. These commonly include experiences such as feelings of inextricable [int-link to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"]unity between oneself and the rest of existence[/int-link], metaphysical insights into the supposed nature of reality, and feelings of deep spiritual reverence towards the universe as a whole.[/p]\n\n[p]A heavy DMT experience is the level at which the practical upper limit of what the substance is capable of producing is reached. At this level, the user will be rendered incapable of functioning and communicating in a manner which will leave them completely disconnected from both their environment and their sense of self.[/p] \n\n[p]In terms of its stages, a heavy DMT trip will usually result in all four stages of the experience.

labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]An extreme DMT experience is the level at which the effects have become so powerful and pronounced that the person will typically be rendered unconscious and [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesic[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]At this level, the person will experience the effects typically associated with the previously described heavy dosage during the brief few seconds of the onset and for up to several minutes during the offset of their trip. Throughout the peak they will simply undergo an [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link], black out, and become unconscious for a prolonged period of time that can range anywhere from 10 minutes to half an hour.[/p]\n\n[p]Although extreme psychedelic states may be attractive to certain individuals, it's important to consider that this level of intensity is both less therapeutic and explorative than the previous levels. However, it is also worth noting that when compared to extreme doses of other psychedelics, DMT is considerably less dangerous at this dosage range due to its extremely short duration and comparative lack of [int-link to=\"/categories/uncomfortable-physical-effects\"]intense physical side effects[/int-link].[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Personal commentary[/h2]\n\n[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"]\n[p]It would not remotely be an understatement to say that DMT is by far one of the most important and intriguing psychoactive substances in existence. The profound ease through which it can reliably transport the majority of people into incomprehensibly complex hallucinatory states is perhaps completely unmatched within the world of hallucinogenic compounds. However, it is because of these capabilities that this substance has developed a reputation which is surrounded by misconceptions and cultural mysticism that I feel the need to address within this section directly.[/p]\n\n[p]For example, the claims that DMT is released by the pineal gland during birth, death, and dreaming are entirely unfounded by the scientific literature. This idea was first popularised by the Richard Strassman's book \"The spirit molecule\" in which it was stated as pure speculation more so than as an evidence-backed theory. Although it is true that DMT is found in trace amounts within a vast number of plants and animals (including humans), there is absolutely no evidence that it is specifically produced by the pineal gland or that it is released in psychedelic amounts during certain situations. In fact, the current scientific consensus regarding the prevalence of DMT within plants and animals seems to suggest that it is most likely a byproduct of biological processes that are entirely unrelated to that of the pineal gland.[/p]\n\n[p]In regards to the specific claim that the neurological mechanism responsible for dream states is due to the pineal gland releasing DMT during REM sleep, I think it is worth mentioning my position that the people who believe this have it completely backwards. In my opinion, it's not that normal sleeping dream states occur because endogenous DMT is being released, but that waking dream states are temporarily induced when dosages of DMT and other psychedelics are ingested which are strong enough to cause the specific subjective effect known as internal hallucinations.[/p]\n\n[p]My reasoning behind this is that there are some interesting commonalities between the behaviour of psychedelic induced hallucinations and dreaming that are too prevalent to discount as purely coincidental. For example, the four-tier levelling systems which I have devised for both internal hallucinations and autonomous entity contact communication can both be applied perfectly to dreams and dream character communication in a manner which does not require any substantial changes to their descriptions. Alongside of this, the amnesia that is commonly experienced during the offset of a DMT experience behaves identically to that of the amnesia which is frequently experienced after waking up from a dream. Last of all and in a more subjective sense, the general feeling of a DMT hallucination feels very dreamlike to me and is commonly described as such by many people.[/p]\n\n[p]While there are some apparent aesthetic and behavioural differences between that of psychedelic internal hallucinations and normal dream states, in my opinion, these can be accounted for by the simultaneous occurrence of other subjective effects alongside these high-level internal hallucinations. For example, the simultaneous experience of psychedelic geometry during a hallucinatory state seems to result in it appearing to be physically comprised of ever-shifting and incomprehensibly complex condensed geometric forms in a manner which gives them their well known \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. In terms of their behaviour, however, the simultaneous experience of an incredibly wide range of cognitive states such as ego death and various transpersonal effects seem to synergise and interplay with the specific effect of internal hallucinations in a manner which results in them displaying themes and concepts which would not ordinarily occur during normal dream states.[/p]\n\n[p]Another even more outlandish although less common claim is that DMT literally transports the user's consciousness to an alternate dimension or higher plane of transcendental existence in which the autonomous entities are it's real and living inhabitants. While this idea has likely been around for as long as DMT has been used by human beings, it was seemingly popularised by Terence Mckenna and his recounts of visiting \"machine elves\" within what he claimed was a real space which legitimately existed somewhere outside of the human subconscious. From his perspective, McKenna hypothesised that the DMT was potentially an access point to a parallel universe, a tool through which extraterrestrials use to communicate with us, a space in which human beings from the future reside, or an afterlife which contains an \"ecology of souls\" of previously living and unborn ancestral spirits.[/p]\n\n[p]On some level, I can definitely empathise with these perspectives as it is easy for me to see how a person could come to these conclusions given how absolutely incomprehensible and profound many DMT experiences can be. However, it is still worth noting that for a variety of different reasons, these conclusions almost definitely arise as a result of undergoing the DMT experience without a general understanding of occums razor, critical thinking, and scepticism.  While these various forms of misinformation may seem relatively harmless, I would argue that spreading them as fact is harmful to our community as it gives people the impression that psychedelic users are irrational proponents of pseudoscientific ideas.[/p][/quote]\n\n[hr /]\n[h2]See Also[/h2]\n[ul]\n[li][int-link to=\"/effects\"]Subjective Effect Index[/int-link][/li]\n[li][int-link to=\"/articles/psychedelic-intensity-scale\"]Psychedelic Intensity Scale[/int-link][/li]\n[li][int-link to=\"/articles/dissociative-intensity-scale\"]Dissociative Intensity Scale[/int-link][/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[h3]External links[/h3]\n[ul]\n[li][ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulgin_Rating_Scale\"]Shulgin Rating Scale (Wikipedia)[/ext-link][/li]\n[/ul]",

      "raw": "[p]For the countless millennia that psychoactive substances have been present in human civilisation, there has not been an established, universally applicable lexicon for articulating experiences of altered states of consciousness. The absence of such terminology has limited our ability to fully understand our own experiences and made discussion and research in this domain difficult. As a result of this need, over the past decade, myself and the greater subjective effect documentation community have been driven to volunteer countless hours of their free time to document their experiences and coin, define, and categorize terms, ultimately culminating in what is now known as the Subjective Effect Index, hosted on EffectIndex.com.[/p] \n\n[p]The Subjective Effect Index or (SEI) is a database of 233 effect descriptions that strives to serve as a comprehensive map of all potential experiences that can occur under the influence of any class of psychoactive compound, particularly hallucinogens. The existing SEI has been increasingly used to facilitate discussion within online psychedelic spaces since around 2012. However, it has not yet reached a level of completeness and polish that would allow it to serve as a universal terminology set. By improving and completing the SEI, we intend to create a tool that will improve our collective ability to research altered states of consciousness and greatly enhance the academic, clinical, therapeutic, personal, and cultural relevance of psychoactive compounds.[/p]\n\n[p]Under the employment of [ext-link to=\"https://www.mindstate.design/\"]Mindstate Design Labs[/ext-link], a Y Combinator startup, I am now leading a project to develop a new version of the SEI with unparalleled comprehensiveness and academic rigor. Experienced scientific researchers are serving as advisors throughout the index's development, these include [ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_S._Ray\"]Thomas S. Ray[/ext-link] a prominent psychedelic scientist who was a close friend of the late Alex Shulgin, [ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_B._Newberg\"]Andrew B. Newburg[/ext-link] the worlds leading expert in Neurotheology, and to a lesser extent [ext-link to=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.carhart-harris\"]Robin Carhart-Harris [/ext-link].[/p]\n\n[p]This project will completely overhaul the overarching organisational structure of the Index and more than double the number of distinct defined effects. It will incorporate a comprehensive literature review of other rudimentary altered state of consciousness ontologies, such as psychometric tools and informal classification systems found within books and online resources. We intend for this project to be fully open source so that it can become a ubiquitous resource analogous to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, providing a defined common lexicon so that researchers and laypeople alike can discuss altered states of consciousness in a succinct yet meaningful way.[/p]\n\n[p]Thanks to my employers, the creation of this particular aspect of the project is already underway. However, outside funding will be necessary to integrate the improved SEI into the Effect Index website and empower the Subjective Effect Documentation community to continue improving the index in our ever-evolving world. As a result of this, I am hoping to raise the necessary funds to hire a Web Developer so that we can both integrate this new ESEI into the site, and bring Effect Index to its full potential as a global source of subjective effect knowledge and discovery.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[p]The existing website has evolved over time through the generous contributions of multiple community volunteers, but it is presently not able to accommodate any significant changes to the overall structure of the content.

      "raw": "[p][b]Dreams[/b] are defined as the succession of hallucinatory images, scenarios, ideas, emotions, and sensations that occur involuntarily within the mind during certain stages of sleep. Although the content and purpose of dreams are not well understood, they have been a topic of philosophical and religious interest throughout much of recorded history. There is also solid scientific evidence that dreams are a common occurrence throughout the lives of not just most human beings, but many other animals as well.[/p]\n\n[p]This article is meant to serve as a companion piece to our [int-link to=\"/articles/lucid-dreaming\"]lucid dreaming[/int-link] article, which focuses on serving as an informational guide for learning to consistently gain a stable sense of lucidity within one's own dreams, as well as the instructional techniques for utilizing and harnessing further control of the dream once this has been achieved. Instead of detailing lucid dreaming techniques, however, this article will attempt to comprehensively document the subjective effects that occur during dream states by breaking them down into their individual sub-components while providing detailed descriptions and leveling systems wherever possible.[/p]\n\n[p]At [i]lower levels[/i], dreams typically manifest as imagery on the back of a person's eyelids, which do not take up the entirety of one's visual field and are distinct from their background. These can be described as spontaneous moving or still images of scenes, concepts, places, or anything one could imagine. The imagery is manifested in varying levels of realism ranging from ill-defined and cartoon-like to wholly realistic. They rarely hold their form for more than a few seconds before fading or shifting into another image. This level typically occurs while the person is either in the process of falling asleep or waking up.[/p]\n\n[p]At [i]higher levels[/i], however, dreams become increasingly elaborate as they eventually become all-encompassing, fully-fledged 3D scenes that surround the person in a similar manner to that of the [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] that can occur under the influences of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic substances. This level typically occurs when the person is in deep sleep.[/p]\n\n[p]In a more comprehensive level of detail, the clarity and immersiveness at which dreams presents themselves can be broken down into the 5 different levels of intensity described below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Enhancement of mental visualization\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]At the lowest level, dreams can be defined as the distinct enhancement of mental visualisation that a person drifts into while daydreaming or using their imagination. It can be described as a short-term detachment from one’s immediate surroundings; during which, a person’s contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by an ill-defined fantasy. The details of this internal visualisation are chosen in a slightly spontaneous or autonomous nature, but are mostly consciously controlled by the content of one’s current thought stream.[/p]\n\n[p]This level is extremely common and often occurs while a person is falling asleep (hypnagogia), while a person is waking up (hypnapompia), and also during general waking consciousness.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]At this level, dreams consist of partially defined, blurred, and faded imagery within a person’s visual field. This is where the content of these dreams usually becomes more spontaneous in nature and out of the person’s conscious control.[/p]\n\n[p]This level is commonly experienced as a person begins to fall asleep. However, it is much less of a universal experience than that of fully fledged dream states.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]At this level, the vividness and intensity increases in a fashion that renders the imagery seen within one’s visual field as fully defined and realistic in its appearance.[/p]\n\n[p]This level is commonly experienced as a person begins to fall asleep. However, it is less of a universal experience than that of fully fledged dream states.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]At this level, the vividness, scope, and intensity of the dream becomes all-encompassing in a way that displays momentary flashes of scenes that surround the person in an immersive environment. Although all-encompassing, they are often very blurred and ill defined in appearance. Additionally, the dreamer's physical body will often still feel at least partially connected to the real world. Other senses, such as touch, taste, and smell, may also be extremely vague or entirely absent.[/p]\n\n[p]This level is commonly experienced during short naps, during the moments of lapsed consciousness that can occur as a result of sleep deprivation, and during states of shallow restless sleep that is being disturbed by suboptimal sleeping conditions.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]At the highest level, dreams further increase to become all-encompassing in a manner that displays long-lasting scenes surrounding the person with an explorable and fully immersive environment. This occurs in a fashion that is fully detailed and highly vivid in its appearance. Typically, it also occurs alongside relevant auditory and tactile sensations.[/p]\n\n[p]This level is commonly experienced during states of deep REM (rapid eye movement), which occurs after approximately 90 minutes of sleep.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]The perception of time in hallucinatory dream scenarios typically feel as if they are being experienced in real-time, which means that if 20 seconds are perceived to have passed within the dream the same amount of time will have elapsed in the real world. However, it is also possible for time distortions to occur, resulting in scenarios and plots that can feel as if they last days, weeks, or even an infinite amount of time.[/p]\n\n[p]The content and behaviour of dreams can be further broken down into six distinct subcomponents. These are described and documented within their own dedicated subsections, each of which are listed below.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Scenarios and plots[/h2]\n[p]The [i]scenarios and plots[/i] that occur within dream are challenging to define in a truly comprehensive manner in much the same way that we cannot really predict the plot of literature or films. However, they generally involve a heavy emphasis on themes and concepts which hold some level of emotional significance to the dreamer or at least occurred within recent memory. However, despite this emphasis, there is also a powerful element of randomness to these plots which can lead these scenarios in a wild variety of directions.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of coherency, scenarios and plots can be linear, with events that occur in a logical sequence and lead into each other through clear cause and effect. Equally likely, however, are scenarios and plots that present themselves as muddled, nonsensical, and incoherent. The plots themselves can also either be entirely new experiences that are unlike anything experienced within the real world, such as the visitation of fantastical worlds or the use of magical powers. Alternatively, old experiences such as the reliving of past memories are also entirely possible. Usually, however, dreams are some combination of these two extremes, such as the visitation of real life locations from the dreamers waking life, combined with meeting strangers, or experiencing fantastical events.[/p]\n\n[p]Regardless of thematic and situational content, dreams are usually accompanied by an uncontrollable sense of plot acceptance. This results in the dreamer almost always accepting any plot within their dream as an entirely real event in which the results of their actions are likely to have genuine consequences, regardless of how absurd and unrealistic the situation may be. When this sense of plot acceptance is overcome, it can result in state known as \"lucid dreaming\". Which is a well documented phenomena that involves the person becoming actively aware of the fact that they are dreaming and with practice, can even take full control of what happens inside of it.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Setting[/h2]\n[p]At levels 4 and 5 dreams consistently manifest themselves through extremely detailed imaginary landscapes, locations, and sceneries of potentially infinite variety. These exist to act as the setting in which the plot of the dream occurs. The geography of these settings is capable of rendering itself as static and coherent in organization, but will usually result in a non-linear, nonsensical, and continuously changing layout which do not obey the laws of physics. The specific locations within these settings appear to be selected at random, and are often entirely new locations that have not been visited in real life. However, there is also often a heavy emphasis on replicating and combining real life locations stored within a person's memories, especially those which are prominent in their daily life or past.[/p]\n\n[p]Within these dreamscapes, relevant and irrelevant objects of any sort typically populate the setting in much the same way that they would in real life. These can usually be interacted with in the same way that any real life object can be, but may react in unexpected and spontaneous ways. Some common examples of this may include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li]Objects such as books, clocks, or anything with text on them being incapable of rendering static information that does not reset and change as soon as the dreamer double takes.[/li]\n  [li]Cars being driveable, but being extremely difficult to control in comparison to their real life equivalents.[/li]\n  [li]Bodies of water remaining breathable, even when the dreamer is completely submerged under them.[/li]\n  [li]Electronic devices such as computers and phones not being fully responsive or functional.[/li]\n  [li]Mirrors displaying incredibly distorted reflections which progressively shapeshift when stared upon.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Dream characters[/h2]\n[p]Throughout the settings of almost any dream, the scenery is often inhabited and populated by [i]dream characters[/i]. These are entities which act autonomous in their behaviour and are capable of communicating through spoken word. They are usually felt and presumed to be living inhabitants of the environment in which the dream is set. They also interact with the dreamer in various ways, are usually completely unaware that they are the inhabitants of a dream, and are typically unsurprised by the dreamers appearance.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of their appearance, dream characters can show themselves as literally anything but will usually display themselves as perfectly ordinary people. These people are equally likely to be complete strangers or randomly selected people which the dreamer has encountered throughout their life. The more prominent and emotionally significant the person is, the more likely they are to be encountered within the dreamscape.[/p]\n\n[p]When communicated with through spoken word the level of coherency in which these entities can reply with is highly variable but can be broken down into 4 distinct levels of communication:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Silence\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, communcation can be described as a complete unresponsiveness from the entity and a lack of speech despite their presence within the dream.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, communication can be described as linguistic conversational responses and noises that almost sound like words but do not contain any real content or meaning beyond a vague sense of emotional intent.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, communication can be described as audible linguistic conversational responses and noises that contain fully defined and understandable words, but often lack grammatical structure or an overall sense of general coherency.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, communication can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain fully defined and understandable words with a partially defined grammatical structure and general coherency. It conveys its point on a level that is frequently coherent, but may not always be fully understandable and will sometimes descend into broken grammar or even gibberish.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the highest level, communication can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain understandable words and fully defined grammatical sentence structures. It has an overall sense of general coherency, which conveys its point in a level of detail that is genuinely on par with that of a person’s own intellect.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Perspectives[/h2]\n[p]The perspective in which dreams are perceived through can be broken down into through the four alternative vantage points described below:[/p]\n[ul]\n[li][b]1st person[/b] - The most common dream perspective, which can be described as the standard experience of perceiving the scenario from the perspective of a person's everyday self and body.[/li]\n[li][b]2nd person[/b] - This perspective can be described as the experience of seeing the dream from the viewpoint of an external source of consciousness, such as another person, an animal, or an inanimate object.[/li]\n[li][b]3rd person[/b] - This perspective is similar to an out-of-body experience and can be described as perceiving a dream from a perspective which is floating above, below, behind, or in front of the dreamer's physical body. It is worth noting that for unknown reasons many people consistently and exclusively dream in the third person perspective.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Amnesia[/h2]\n[p]Once a person has woken up from their dream, they will often find that their memory of what happened within the dream quickly begins to fade. This amnesia varies in its intensity from person to person, with some people never remembering their dreams and others remembering their dreams almost every single night. However, dream related amnesia can be combatted using techniques such as immediately writing in a dream journal upon waking up, and generally making a conscious effort to regularly pay more attention to one's own dreams.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]See Also[/h2]\n[ul]\n[li][int-link to=\"/effects\"]Subjective Effect Index[/int-link][/li]\n[li][int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]Internal hallucination[/int-link][/li]\n[li][int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]Autonomous entity[/int-link][/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[h3]External links[/h3]\n[ul]\n[li][ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream\"]Dream (Wikipedia)[/ext-link][/li]\n[li][ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream\"]Lucid dream (Wikipedia)[/ext-link][/li]\n[/ul]",

These structures are usually formed from solid materials which can take the form of any shape. However, common examples include vast and monolithic pillars, columns, tunnels, blocks, buildings, slides, monuments, wheels, pyramids, caves, and a variety of abstract or fractal shapes."

At this level, the effects of the substance are clear and can no longer be ignored in any capacity, leaving the user entirely engaged in the experience whether they wish to be or not.

Users will start to experience blurred and double vision while anesthetic-like effects such as tactile numbness begin to take place. At this point, motor control, coordination, and balance become somewhat suppressed and mechanical in a manner that is partially compensated for by a feeling of the body being in \"autopilot\". In terms of sound, the sense of hearing also seems to become vague, muffled, and distant.[/p]\n\n[p]Accompanying these effects are a number of inconsistent and brief visual distortions that may occur spontaneously during certain dissociative experiences. These distortions can include alterations in perceived distances between objects, visual segmentation of one's vision into glitch-like cubes or slices, and changes to the perceived size of one's body or environment.[/p]\n\n[p]During this level, if one allows themselves to relax while closing their eyes, they may fleetingly find themselves drifting off into a darkened hallucinatory void filled with simplistic shapes, forms, and structures. This is usually a very brief experience which can easily be interrupted by external stimuli such as noises and other general distractions.[/p]\n\n[p]Depending on the person's level of experience, these effects can be allowed to occupy a predominant role within the person's perception or they may be mostly ignored and made somewhat secondary to other chosen activities.[/p]\n\n[p]The specific distinct effects which generally occur at this level of intensity are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, each of which are listed below.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[columns]\n[column]\n[panel title=\"Sensory\" icon=\"eye.svg\"]\n[ul]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-suppression\"]Auditory suppression[/int-link][/b] [sup](common)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/double-vision\"]Double vision[/int-link][/b] [sup](level 1-2 / frequent)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/environmental-cubism\"]Environmental cubism[/int-link][/b] [sup](rare)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/perspective-distortion\"]Perspective distotion[/int-link][/b] [sup](uncommon)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/scenery-slicing\"]Scenery slicing[/int-link][/b] [sup](uncommon)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/tactile-suppression\"]Tactile suppression[/int-link][/b] [sup](common)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/visual-acuity-suppression\"]Visual acuity suppression[/int-link][/b] [sup](frequent)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection\"]Visual disconnection[/int-link][/b] [sup](frequent)[/sup][/li]\n[ul][li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]Holes, spaces, and voids[/int-link][/b] [sup](common)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures\"]Structures[/int-link][/b] [sup](level 1-2 / common)[/sup][/li][/ul]\n[/ul]\n[/panel]\n[/column]\n  \n[column]\n[panel title=\"Cognitive\" icon=\"user.svg\"]\n[ul]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety-suppression\"]Anxiety suppression[/int-link][/b] [sup](common)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-disconnection\"]Cognitive disconnection[/int-link][/b] [sup](frequent)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/conceptual-thinking\"]Conceptual thinking[/int-link][/b] [sup](common)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/depersonalization\"]Depersonalization[/int-link][/b] [sup](common)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/derealization\"]Derealization[/int-link][/b] [sup](common)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/existential-self-realization\"]Existential self realization[/int-link][/b] [sup](common)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/increased-music-appreciation\"]Increased music appreciation[/int-link][/b] [sup](frequent)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/immersion-enhancement\"]Immersion enhanement[/int-link][/b] [sup](frequent)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/introspection\"]Introspection[/int-link][/b] [sup](common)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/novelty-enhancement\"]Novelty enhancement[/int-link][/b] [sup](frequent)[/sup][/li]\n[/ul]\n[/panel]\n[/column]\n\n[column]\n[panel title=\"Physical\" icon=\"child.svg\"]\n[ul]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/pain-relief\"]Pain relief[/int-link][/b] [sup](frequent)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/physical-autonomy\"]Physical autonomy[/int-link][/b] [sup](common)[/sup][/li]\n[/ul]\n[/panel]\n[/column]\n[/columns]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Strong\" labelBackground=\"#8f8e8d\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]At this level, the sensory and cognitive disconnection has completely blocked out one’s perception of the external environment. It is here where the person finds themselves undergoing an out-of-body experience as they float in a variety of directions and orientations through a dissociative hole which can be described as a expansive darkened void containing a wide array of hallucinatory content and structures. These structures are usually formed from solid materials which can take the form of any shape. However, common examples include vast and monolithic pillars, columns, tunnels, blocks, buildings, slides, monuments, wheels, pyramids, caves, and a variety of abstract or fractal shapes.[/p]\n\n[p]Depending on the dissociative consumed, the effect known as geometry may also occur to varying extents. However, it is worth noting that dissociative geometry rarely exceeds level 4 and is generally far more simplistic and colourless than that of its psychedelic counterpart.\nThis is the level at which the effects become powerful enough to render the person undergoing them as incapable of functioning, interacting normally, or thinking in a sober manner. At this level, the effects of the substance are clear and can no longer be ignored in any capacity, leaving the user entirely engaged in the experience whether they wish to be or not.

It is also found as a naturally occurring endogenous byproduct within a huge variety of plants and animals, [ext-link to=\"https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/dta.422\"]including humans[/ext-link]. The substance itself induces a brief but extremely intense psychedelic experience, alongside a disproportionate amount of hallucinatory content in comparison to other traditional psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, and mescaline.[/p]\n\n[p]This article exclusively discusses DMT’s subjective effects. If you would like to learn more about DMT's chemistry, pharmacology, history, legality, and potential dangers, refer to its PsychonautWiki article [ext-link to=\"https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT\"]here[/ext-link].[/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Duration[/h2]\n[ul]\n[li][b]Total :[/b] 5 - 20 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Onset :[/b] 20 - 40 seconds[/li]\n[li][b]Come up :[/b] 1 - 3 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Peak :[/b] 2 - 8 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Offset :[/b] 1 - 6 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]After effects :[/b] 10 - 60 minutes[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]These durations only apply to DMT that is being smoked or vaporised. DMT is not active through oral ingestion unless an MAOI or an RIMA (such as syrian rue or B. caapi vine) is consumed approximately 30 - 60 minutes prior to DMT. This substantially changes the subjective effect profile of the compound, so much that it is usually discussed as distinct experience: “Ayahuasca” is DMT prepared for oral ingestion using traditional plant sources, while “pharmahuasca” colloquially refers to preparations made with crystalized DMT or psychiatric/synthetic MAOIs.[/p]\n\n[p]Besides vaporizing and oral ingestion, less effective (and consequently less common) routes of administration include insufflation, rectal suppository, and sublingual absorption. In clinical settings, DMT is typically administered intravenously, which can allowed for a prolonged immersive hallucinatory state. Recreational intravenous use is also uncommon as it requires medical equipment, training, and pharmaceutical-grade DMT.[/p]\n\n[p]The duration of a DMT trip seems to progress through four separate stages of experience that each feel distinct. At heavy dosages the user may find themselves progressing through all of these stages in sequence, while low-dose experiences may skip over stages 2 or 3. These stages are described and documented below.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Taking off\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"chart-line.svg\"]\n[p]The first stage of a DMT trip is the onset, which leads into what is commonly referred to as \"breaking through\".[/p]\n\n[p]As the user smokes DMT, effects typically begins with the sudden onset of distinct [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-enhancements\"]visual enhancements[/int-link], which are immediately followed by high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] and a [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]warm tingling sensation[/int-link]. At higher dosages, the user may find the pipe that they are using to smoke their DMT has transformed into an incomprehensible mass of geometry that is quite difficult to put down or hand off to someone nearby. There may also be [int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-hallucination\"]auditory hallucinations[/int-link] that resemble soft crackling. For example, some users report an extended tone that quickly rises in volume and pitch as the intensity of [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-effects\"]visual effects[/int-link] also increases.[/p]\n\n[p]This sound (which is replicated above) typically becomes all-enveloping and abruptly ends as one of several different “take off” variations are experienced. These include, but are not limited to:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li]Increasingly intense [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link], which becomes so all-enveloping that the visible environment is completely blocked out and replaced.[/li]\n[li]Feelings of being suddenly pushed through – and onto – the other side of a membrane.[/li]\n[li]The environment forming into a geometry-filled tunnel, which the user moves into as it widens and subsequently encompasses their entire vision.[/li]\n[li]The environment splitting into separated sections, leaving a gaping chasm filled with high-level geometry as the user separates from their body and is then catapulted directly into it at a high speed.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]This process of \"taking off\" typically occurs within the range of about 30 seconds to a minute, and leads directly onto the second stage of a DMT trip.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 2\" header=\"The Waiting Room\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"hourglass.svg\"]\n[p]Almost immediately after a person has smoked enough DMT to “[i]take off[/i]”, they sometimes find themselves spending approximately 10 - 30 seconds in what is often described as a psychedelic “[i]waiting room[/i]”. It can take on any appearance, but most commonly presents itself as a tunnel, room, or space that is comprised of fast moving [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]In fact, this \"waiting room\" feels distinctively different from the main bulk of the trip to such an extent that it has led many DMT users to speculate that it is potentially some sort of psychedelic loading screen, during which the upcoming trip is being generated and planned out by the subconscious mind.[/p]\n\n[p]After “taking off”, the person will usually transition into the most impressive stage of the experience. However, in certain cases the user may feel stuck within the waiting room, and may even experience hallucinatory [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] suggesting that they are not yet ready to proceed past it. It is also important to note that although still relatively common in its occurrence, the waiting room is the least consistent stage of a DMT trip, and many users will never experience it all while simply finding that their DMT trips skip over it.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 3\" header=\"The Other Side\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"geometry.svg\"]\n[p]Once the waiting room stage is either finished or skipped over, the user will feel that they have broken through into what is commonly referred to as the \"other side\". It is here where an incredibly wide variety of potential hallucinatory content can manifest itself. However, this intensified stage will still usually follow somewhat consistent themes and archetypes that are reported by many people who experience the substance.[/p]\n\n[p]These themes generally consist of visiting a hallucinated alternate reality that is sometimes reported to feel \"more real\" than everyday life. In terms of their visual aesthetic, these hallucinatory spaces usually consist of incomprehensibly complex psychedelic [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] that is condensed into [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]settings or scenes[/int-link]. Examples of DMT spaces include landscapes, fractalscapes, rooms, buildings, cities, tunnels, caverns, non-euclidean structures resembling a hive or nest, womb-like environments, and an infinite variety of potential others.[/p]\n\n[p]Within DMT spaces, there are often one or more [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link] within the user's perceived field of vision. These entities frequently act as if they have been waiting for the user's arrival, and are usually unphased by the person's sudden apparition. Upon noticing the user, DMT entities may enthusiastically greet them but reactions of surprise, indifference, or ambivalence are equally common. These entities may also convey a sense of urgency, as though attempting to demonstrate a multitude of incredible things during the short amount of time that they have before the effects of the drug wear off.[/p]\n\n[p]During these experiences, [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] may employ a variety of [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity?s=communication-styles\"]communnication styles[/int-link], including: [i]spoken language, direct manipulation of the visual environment, choreographed movement, telepathy, beams of energy or information, visual languages, or any combination of these[/i]. Through means such as these, entities often seemingly attempt to either explain some message to the user, or provide a guided tour of some aspect of the [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link] which they inhabit. The message often feels personalized and related to the user's life or emotional well-being, but can also contain aspects that seem entirely nonsensical or ineffable when removed from the context of the DMT trip.[/p]\n\n[p]These [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] will often dubiously present themselves as all-knowing, and although they can take any visual form, some visual archetypes are more commonly experienced. These archetypes include [i]humanoids, aliens, elves, insectoids, giant spheres, beings of light, plants, jesters, maternal or nurturing guardians, and complex robotic machines[/i]. At this point it is common for the user (unless they are very experienced) to be completely overwhelmed by the DMT trip, despite feeling relatively clear-headed. This sometimes results in the entities encouraging the user to stay calm, not to give into astonishment, and to simply try to pay attention to what is happening.[/p]\n\n[p]Although they are common, it is worth noting that these [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entity[/int-link]-filled [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]hallucinatory spaces[/int-link] do not necessarily occur for every person and are not entirely consistent in their manifestation between trips. A certain number of people do not seem to experience hallucinations at all, and instead simply find themselves engulfed in all-encompassing high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] during this stage of the DMT trip. Thus, the frequency with which any given user encounters entity-filled DMT spaces varies.[/p]\n\n[p]After 2 - 10 minutes of this experience, the DMT trip will begin to wear off while moving into its fourth and final stage.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 4\" header=\"Coming Down\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"chart-line-down.svg\"]\n[p]The final stage concludes the trip, with either the sensation of being pulled progressively further away from the [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link], or the hallucinations becoming increasingly vague and ill-defined until imperceptible. During this process, the [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] will sometimes bid farewell and encourage the person to return if given the chance.[/p]\n\n[p]Once over, the user immediately finds themselves back in reality with strong level 4 - 5 visual [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] which quickly fades. Similar to how the content of a dream is commonly forgotten upon waking up, detailed memories of DMT experiences also often rapidly deteriorate upon returning to baseline consciousness. This [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link] can be counteracted by taking notes, recounting the trip to another person in detail, recording a narration of the experience on audio or video, or using other such method.[/p]\n\n[p]As the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] becomes more mild and [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link] sets in, the user will often experience a sense of being [int-link to=\"/effects/physical-euphoria\"]bathed in euphoria and awe[/int-link]. The geometry typically persists for an additional 5 - 10 minutes before disappearing completely, leaving a strong [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]body high[/int-link] that can persist for up to half an hour in extreme cases. This afterglow typically feels like a warm fuzziness throughout the body, and often leaves behind a sense of cognitive [int-link to=\"/effects/rejuvenation\"]rejuvenation[/int-link], well-being, and mental clarity which can last for hours, days, or even weeks after the trip.[/p]\n\n[p]However, it is worth noting that if the user has consumed a dosage that is not strong enough to reach stages two and three, then this experience of coming down will simply manifest as a progressive reduction of intensity without any of the aforementioned effects or details.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n[h2]Intensity Scale[/h2]\n[p]This intensity scale breaks the subjective effects of DMT into six distinct levels, in which each level typically contains an expanding list of effects that generally intensify relative to the dosage consumed. The approximate frequency of occurrence is also listed alongside each effect. For an explanation of the terms used within this frequency measuring system, please see the article [int-link to=\"/articles/approximate-frequency-of-occurrence-scale\"]here[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]Although the dosages listed here are a useful average, it is important to keep in mind that the DMT dosage required to reach a particular range of effects varies between individuals depending on their body weight and respective neurochemistry.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Subtle\" subHeader=\"2-10 mg\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]A subtle DMT experience is the level at which it first becomes apparent that the substance is producing effects. This is typically comprised of benign sensory and cognitive effects such as [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-amplifications\"]visual amplifications[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-distortions\"]visual distortions[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/categories/cognitive-effects\"]cognitive alterations[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]Although this experience is more distinct than a placebo, the substances effects may not demand the user’s attention and can be willfully ignored. For example, if the user is distracted, they may not even notice the effects.[/p]\n\n[p]At most, a subtle DMT trip may resemble an incredibly mild version of the \"take off\" stage of the experience, skipping over stages two and three.

These effects include a range of well-defined [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-amplifications\"]visual amplifications[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-distortions\"]visual distortions[/int-link], complex [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link], mild [int-link to=\"/categories/hallucinatory-states\"]hallucinatory states[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/categories/cognitive-effects\"]cognitive effects[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]spontaneous tactile sensations[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]The [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry?s=variations\"]style variations[/int-link] of DMT’s visual geometry generally feature [i]intricate complexity, abstract form, structured organization, bright lighting, a full or expanded color range, glossy shading, varied roundness and angularity, large size, rapid speed, a smooth perceived framerate, immersion, and consistent intensity[/i]. At higher doses, this geometry is significantly more likely to result in states of [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-exposure-to-inner-mechanics-of-consciousness\"]visual exposure to the inner mechanics of consciousness[/int-link] rather than a [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-exposure-to-semantic-concept-network\"]visual exposure to one's semantic concept network[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]It is also worth noting that the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] induced by vaporized DMT is widely considered to be the most profoundly intricate and complex manifestation of this effect out of any and all psychedelic drugs. Compared to the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry?s=variations\"]style of geometry[/int-link] produced by ayahuasca, the geometry appears more synthetic and digital in material composition, demonstrates colour schemes that are similar to those experienced on LSD, and has an organized geometric structure reminiscent of that produced by psilocybin.[/p]\n\n[p]At this level, spontaneous tactile sensations become pronounced and fully manifested. The [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations?s=variations\"]style variations of these bodily sensations[/int-link] includes [i]a constant duration, feelings of movement, gentle character, all-encompassing placement, and euphoric emotion[/i]. This sensation typically maintains a consistent presence that quickly rises with the onset and hits a limit once the peak has been reached. It is capable of becoming very powerful at higher doses and can sometimes persist for up to half an hour after the experience itself has ended.[/p]\n\n[p]Although they are substantially less common than internal hallucinations, [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link] can also occasionally occur with heavy doses of DMT. These typically consist of a mixture of realistic and [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link]-based hallucinations of either real objects within the surrounding environment \"[int-link to=\"/effects/object-activation\"]coming to life[/int-link])\", the entirety of the environment changing in its visual character, or sudden apparitions such as the appearance of [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link]. The [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination?s=variations\"]style variations[/int-link] of these external hallucinations is [i]lucid awareness, an immersed viewpoint, novel subject matter, autonomous and non-controllable, and equally likely to be either realistic in appearance or comprised of psychedelic geometry[/i]. Although external hallucinations are more common under the influence of DMT in comparison to other psychedelics, they are still quite uncommon and may never be experienced even by regular users.[/p]\n\n[p]During a distinct DMT experience, the effects and the nature of the substance become well-defined enough that ignoring its effects is difficult.

The user typically feels like they have broken through into the hallucinatory [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link], as previously described in the \"[i]other side[/i]\" section of this video.[/p]\n\n[p]For most people, a strong dose of DMT will produce high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] more consistently than any other psychedelic. The style variations of these internal hallucinations is that they are usually [i]lucid in awareness, interactive, novel in subject, autonomous and non-controllable, and psychedelic in appearance[/i]. This is accompanied by other hallucinatory effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]sceneries and landscapes[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]narrative scenarios[/int-link]. These hallucinations can involve an endless variety of themes that may be personal, religious, spiritual, futuristic, magical, surreal, nonsensical, or transcendental in nature.[/p]\n\n[p]It's also worth mentioning that during the onset of this intensity range and above, the user will often experiences [int-link to=\"/effects/changes-in-felt-gravity\"]changes in their perception of gravity[/int-link] which commonly involve feelings of floating at extreme speeds either forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards, or in an unspecifiable direction. This will usually stop once the user has reached their \"destination\" but will often continue at a much slower pace if the hallucination involves moving around within a specific location.[/p]\n\n[p]Despite intense hallucinations at this dosage range, the user will often still feel partially connected to their physical body even while traversing [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]hallucinatory spaces[/int-link]. Most users will also automatically close their eyes and allow themselves to be immersed in the internal experience – however, if the user suddenly opens their eyes midway through the trip, they will likely leave the hallucinatory space. Upon interrupting their [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], the user will typically experience much less-intense [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-effects\"]visual effects[/int-link] with their eyes open. These effects typically include strong [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-distortions\"]visual distortions[/int-link] and highly complex [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] that almost completely cover the user's field of view. Upon closing their eyes again, the user may find themselves placed directly back into the same [int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]hallucinatory scenario[/int-link], or they may simply experience high-level geometry while being unable to completely re-enter their internal hallucination.[/p]\n\n[p]During less intense DMT breakthroughs experienced at this dosage range, many users report feeling surprisingly lucid and clear-headed in comparison to an equally-intense dose of psilocybin, mescaline, or LSD. However, the insightful and therapeutic cognitive effects that are heavily associated with psychedelic experiences are frequently either entirely absent or significantly reduced. This may be a result of DMT's extremely short duration, which does not allow the person much time to deeply contemplate or experience its cognitive effects.[/p]\n\nIf the user is inexperienced with psychedelic substances while undergoing this dosage range or above, they may find themselves experiencing [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety\"]anxiety[/int-link] and fear throughout the duration of the trip. This is not because DMT is inherently anxiety-inducing, but is more likely a response to being thrust into a profoundly complex, bizarre, overwhelming, and unfamiliar situation. As with any hallucinogen, it is always safest to slowly increase an inexperienced person's dosage in small increments over the course of multiple trips, and at a rate which the user is comfortable with. \n\n[p]A strong DMT experience is powerful enough to render the user mostly incapable of functioning normally, social interactions, or thinking in a sober manner. At this level of intensity, the effects of the substance are obvious and cannot be ignored in any capacity, leaving the user completely engaged in the experience whether they wish to be or not.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of its stages, a strong DMT trip will usually result in all four stages of the experience, but with the \"other side\" being distinctly present – although it will still become more defined at higher dosages. The effects that generally occur at this level of intensity are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, listed below.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[columns]\n[column]\n[panel

Alongside this, the content of these hallucinations may be significantly more likely to adopt themes that are commonly interpreted as being \"otherworldly\", \"alien\", \"transcendent\", or from a \"higher plane of existence\".  On the contrary, many people also report that at this level their hallucinations do not become better defined, but instead break down and become increasingly fast-moving, formless, rapidly shapeshifting, and incoherent.[/p]\n\n[p]In regards to the person's cognition and general state of mind at this level, there is a much higher likelihood of intense [int-link to=\"/categories/transpersonal-effects\"]transpersonal states[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/spirituality-enhancement\"]spirituality enhancement[/int-link].

rendered unconscious and [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesic[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]At this level, the person will experience the effects typically associated with the previously described heavy dosage during the brief few seconds of the onset and for up to several minutes during the offset of their trip. Throughout the peak they will simply undergo an [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link], black out, and become unconscious for a prolonged period of time that can range anywhere from 10 minutes to half an hour.[/p]\n\n[p]Although extreme psychedelic states may be attractive to certain individuals, it's important to consider that this level of intensity is both less therapeutic and explorative than the previous levels. However, it is also worth noting that when compared to extreme doses of other psychedelics, DMT is considerably less dangerous at this dosage range due to its extremely short duration and comparative lack of [int-link to=\"/categories/uncomfortable-physical-effects\"]intense physical side effects[/int-link].[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Personal commentary[/h2]\n\n[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"]\n[p]It would not remotely be an understatement to say that DMT is by far one of the most important and intriguing psychoactive substances in existence. The profound ease through which it can reliably transport the majority of people into incomprehensibly complex hallucinatory states is perhaps completely unmatched within the world of hallucinogenic compounds. However, it is because of these capabilities that this substance has developed a reputation which is surrounded by misconceptions and cultural mysticism that I feel the need to address within this section directly.[/p]\n\n[p]For example, the claims that DMT is released by the pineal gland during birth, death, and dreaming are entirely unfounded by the scientific literature. This idea was first popularised by the Richard Strassman's book \"The spirit molecule\" in which it was stated as pure speculation more so than as an evidence-backed theory. Although it is true that DMT is found in trace amounts within a vast number of plants and animals (including humans), there is absolutely no evidence that it is specifically produced by the pineal gland or that it is released in psychedelic amounts during certain situations. In fact, the current scientific consensus regarding the prevalence of DMT within plants and animals seems to suggest that it is most likely a byproduct of biological processes that are entirely unrelated to that of the pineal gland.[/p]\n\n[p]In regards to the specific claim that the neurological mechanism responsible for dream states is due to the pineal gland releasing DMT during REM sleep, I think it is worth mentioning my position that the people who believe this have it completely backwards. In my opinion, it's not that normal sleeping dream states occur because endogenous DMT is being released, but that waking dream states are temporarily induced when dosages of DMT and other psychedelics are ingested which are strong enough to cause the specific subjective effect known as internal hallucinations.[/p]\n\n[p]My reasoning behind this is that there are some interesting commonalities between the behaviour of psychedelic induced hallucinations and dreaming that are too prevalent to discount as purely coincidental. For example, the four-tier levelling systems which I have devised for both internal hallucinations and autonomous entity contact communication can both be applied perfectly to dreams and dream character communication in a manner which does not require any substantial changes to their descriptions. Alongside of this, the amnesia that is commonly experienced during the offset of a DMT experience behaves identically to that of the amnesia which is frequently experienced after waking up from a dream. Last of all and in a more subjective sense, the general feeling of a DMT hallucination feels very dreamlike to me and is commonly described as such by many people.[/p]\n\n[p]While there are some apparent aesthetic and behavioural differences between that of psychedelic internal hallucinations and normal dream states, in my opinion, these can be accounted for by the simultaneous occurrence of other subjective effects alongside these high-level internal hallucinations. For example, the simultaneous experience of psychedelic geometry during a hallucinatory state seems to result in it appearing to be physically comprised of ever-shifting and incomprehensibly complex condensed geometric forms in a manner which gives them their well known \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. In terms of their behaviour, however, the simultaneous experience of an incredibly wide range of cognitive states such as ego death and various transpersonal effects seem to synergise and interplay with the specific effect of internal hallucinations in a manner which results in them displaying themes and concepts which would not ordinarily occur during normal dream states.[/p]\n\n[p]Another even more outlandish although less common claim is that DMT literally transports the user's consciousness to an alternate dimension or higher plane of transcendental existence in which the autonomous entities are it's real and living inhabitants. While this idea has likely been around for as long as DMT has been used by human beings, it was seemingly popularised by Terence Mckenna and his recounts of visiting \"machine elves\" within what he claimed was a real space which legitimately existed somewhere outside of the human subconscious. From his perspective, McKenna hypothesised that the DMT was potentially an access point to a parallel universe, a tool through which extraterrestrials use to communicate with us, a space in which human beings from the future reside, or an afterlife which contains an \"ecology of souls\" of previously living and unborn ancestral spirits.[/p]\n\n[p]On some level, I can definitely empathise with these perspectives as it is easy for me to see how a person could come to these conclusions given how absolutely incomprehensible and profound many DMT experiences can be. However, it is still worth noting that for a variety of different reasons, these conclusions almost definitely arise as a result of undergoing the DMT experience without a general understanding of occums razor, critical thinking, and scepticism.  While these various forms of misinformation may seem relatively harmless, I would argue that spreading them as fact is harmful to our community as it gives people the impression that psychedelic users are irrational proponents of pseudoscientific ideas.[/p][/quote]\n\n[hr /]\n[h2]See Also[/h2]\n[ul]\n[li][int-link to=\"/effects\"]Subjective Effect Index[/int-link][/li]\n[li][int-link to=\"/articles/psychedelic-intensity-scale\"]Psychedelic Intensity Scale[/int-link][/li]\n[li][int-link to=\"/articles/dissociative-intensity-scale\"]Dissociative Intensity Scale[/int-link][/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[h3]External links[/h3]\n[ul]\n[li][ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulgin_Rating_Scale\"]Shulgin Rating Scale (Wikipedia)[/ext-link][/li]\n[/ul]",

This idea was first popularised by the Richard Strassman's book \"The spirit molecule\" in which it was stated as pure speculation more so than as an evidence-backed theory. Although it is true that DMT is found in trace amounts within a vast number of plants and animals (including humans), there is absolutely no evidence that it is specifically produced by the pineal gland or that it is released in psychedelic amounts during certain situations. In fact, the current scientific consensus regarding the prevalence of DMT within plants and animals seems to suggest that it is most likely a byproduct of biological processes that are entirely unrelated to that of the pineal gland."

Alongside of this, the amnesia that is commonly experienced during the offset of a DMT experience behaves identically to that of the amnesia which is frequently experienced after waking up from a dream. Last of all and in a more subjective sense, the general feeling of a DMT hallucination feels very dreamlike to me and is commonly described as such by many people."

For example, the simultaneous experience of psychedelic geometry during a hallucinatory state seems to result in it appearing to be physically comprised of ever-shifting and incomprehensibly complex condensed geometric forms in a manner which gives them their well known \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. In terms of their behaviour, however, the simultaneous experience of an incredibly wide range of cognitive states such as ego death and various transpersonal effects seem to synergise and interplay with the specific effect of internal hallucinations in a manner which results in them displaying themes and concepts which would not ordinarily occur during normal dream states."

While this idea has likely been around for as long as DMT has been used by human beings, it was seemingly popularised by Terence Mckenna and his recounts of visiting \"machine elves\" within what he claimed was a real space which legitimately existed somewhere outside of the human subconscious. From his perspective, McKenna hypothesised that the DMT was potentially an access point to a parallel universe, a tool through which extraterrestrials use to communicate with us, a space in which human beings from the future reside, or an afterlife which contains an \"ecology of souls\" of previously living and unborn ancestral spirits."

In this video I'm going to describe and discuss the effects of Unity and Interconnectedness from the Subjective Effect Index. This is an incredibly profound and transformative experience that most commonly occurs under the influence of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link], and entactogenic compounds, though it can also occur during well-practiced meditation, deep states of contemplation, intense focus, near death experiences, or even spontaneously without any obvious trigger.[/b][/p] \n\n[p][b]This experience and its associated philosophies have huge cultural, religious, and historical significance outside of the SEI, to the point where it goes by a wide variety of names and terms - I will do my best to cover some of those in more detail towards the end of the video. I’ve put a lot of effort into formalizing terminology for discussing these kinds of effects without resorting to metaphors or analogies that are common in personal trip reports.[/b][/p]\n\n[p][b]Unity and interconnectedness refers to the feeling that things which are normally considered to be separate are actually interconnected or are the same thing entirely, and especially that a person’s sense of self has been expanded to include one or more concepts that would typically be considered separate from them. For example, a person may feel like there is no true separation between themself and the environment around them. This experience can be interpreted as the removal of an illusion that there ever was a genuine separation between the self and the surrounding environment in the first place.[/b][/p]\n\n[p] [/p]\n\n[toc /]\n\n[h2 id=\"levels of Intensity\"]Levels of intensity[/h2]\n\n[p]I have identified four distinct levels of unity and interconnectedness, with level one being the simplest and level four being the most complex.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"level-1\" label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Unity between specific external systems\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]Level one is the perception of a unity between two or more things which are usually perceived as separate from each other within the external environment.[/p]\n\n[p]All levels of unity and interconnectedness can manifest in endless ways, but common examples of level one include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] A sense of unity between specific living things, such as animals or plants and their surrounding ecosystems. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between other human beings and the objects they are currently interacting with. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between any number of currently perceivable inanimate objects. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between humanity and nature. [/li]\n  [li] And finally, a sense of unity between literally any combination of perceivable external systems and concepts. [/li]\n[/ul]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"level-2\" label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Unity between the self and specific external systems\" labelBackground=\"#999997\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]Level two is the feeling that one's identity has come to include something within the immediate external environment, particularly something that is currently the subject of a person's attention. This creates a sensation of becoming inextricably \"[i]connected to[/i]\", \"[i]one with[/i]\", \"[i]the same as[/i]\", or \"[i]unified[/i]\" with that thing.\n[/p]\n\n[p]Common examples of level two include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li] Becoming unified with and identifying with a specific object that one is interacting with.

This effect creates a sensation that the boundaries between a person and the world around them have been stripped down, resulting in the compelling perspective that someone is their environment, that the environment therefore has a consciousness, and this conscious environment is now experiencing itself through the point of view of the person’s individual sensory awareness.[/p]\n\n[p]This level introduces a key component of high-level unity - once a person's sense of self has become unified with their surroundings, their experience of interacting with those surroundings is fundamentally transformed. While undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object can feel like a whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself. For example, if a person experiencing level three unity is thirsty, it doesn’t feel like a person is going to get water. Instead, it feels like the overall system has identified a requirement within one of its subsystems, and is therefore harmoniously rearranging itself to fulfill the requirement.[/p] [/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"level-4\" label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Unity between the self and all known external systems\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n\n[p]At the highest level, Unity can feel as if one is simultaneously the entirety of the perceivable environment and all known concepts that exist outside of it. This will typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted as \"[i]becoming one with the universe[/i]\".[/p]\n\n[p]When experienced, this effect creates the sudden perspective that one is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through a specific point in space and time, specifically, the person experiencing the effect. People who undergo this experience commonly interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of profound “[i]awakening[/i]” or “[i]enlightenment[/i].”[/p]\n\n[p]Many reported experiences of level 4 unity and interconnectedness share common themes of a religious and metaphysical nature. Some examples include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li] The sudden and total acceptance of death as an aspect of life and existence. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of oneself, but simply the end of this specific point in the greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as inevitable and not a cause for grief or any emotional attachment. [/li]\n[li] The subjective perspective that one's conception of \"god\" or “godhood” is identical or similar to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all power (omnipotence) and all knowledge (omniscience), and is the creator and sustainer of existence, then the universe and its contents could also be understood as \"god\". This realisation is extremely similar to the core tenants of the religion of Pantheism.[/li]\n[li] The subjective perspective that one, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all of humanity's sufferings and flaws, but also includes its acts of love and achievements. [/li]\n[/ul]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"further-reading\"]Academic, Philosophical, and Religious examples...[/h2]\n\n[p]Similar accounts of experiences with unity and the apparent illusory nature of the self are present across a surprisingly large variety of independent religious, philosophical, scientific, literary, and cultural sources - to the extent that it would be extremely impractical for me to list them all here. So instead, I'll just summarise a few of the more interesting and easily citable examples.[/p]\n\n[p]The first examples I'd like to mention are some of the many other altered state ontologies which include this experience.[/p] \n\n[ul]\n\n[li]For example, in the 11-D altered states of consciousness scale, one of its 3 major factors is called \"oceanic boundlessness,\" and it includes an entire subfactor titled \"Experience of Unity\".[/li]\n\n[li]Benny Shanon's book the Antipode's of the Mind lists Unity as a subtype of Spiritual and Mystical Experience within the chapter on Ayahuasca-Induced Non-Ordinary Effects of Consciousness.[/li]\n\n[li]The Shulgin Rating Scale describes an experience of high level unity and insists that learning how to reliably induce it would be \"the ultimate evolution and the end of the human experiment.\"[/li]\n\n[li]Stanislov Grof includes a detailed description of \"Oneness with Life and All Creation\" alongside other similar experiences within his extremely frustrating book titled \"Realms of the Human Unconscious\".[/li] \n\n[li]The Mystical Experience Questionnaire, a widely used and validated psychometric tool for measuring mystical experiences, divides the experience into Internal Unity and External Unity. There are also a number of brief references to states of Unity in similar validated psychometric scales I've found within this book titled \"Measures of Religiosity\".[/li]\n\n[li] Moving onto philosophical and spiritual examples... [ext-link to=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneness_(metaphysics)\"] Monism [/ext-link] is a philosophical position that attributes an inherent oneness or singleness to the overall concept of existence. This philosophy also includes numerous variations and subschools of thought such as priority monism, existence monism, substance monism, dual-aspect monism, and neutral monism, and my personal favourite, dialectical monism.[/li]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts\"] Alan Watts [/ext-link] is a philosopher who spoke extensively about the illusory nature of the self. His lectures can be found for free on [ext-link to=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=alan+watts+lecture+series\"]YouTube[/ext-link]. His book “The Book: on the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are” describes the philosophies and logic behind this perspective, and I would highly recomend it.\n\n[li]In the 1901 book Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind, psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke explores his concept of cosmic consciousness, which he defines as \"a higher form of consciousness than that possessed by the ordinary man\". This somewhat manically written book describes a state of high level unity and interconnectedness quite directly, including a large number of relevant case studies and examples.[/li]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism\"]Nondualism[/ext-link] is a spiritual concept with an extremely varied set of definitions found in different forms within many religions. Generally speaking, however, it \"teaches that the multiplicity of the universe is reducible to one essential reality.\" There is also even an active and passionate community on reddit under the name of /r/nonduality with around 12000 subscribers and a wide variety of entertaining nondualist memes.[/li]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam%C4%81dhi\"]Samadhi [/ext-link], a Buddhist concept, describes a state of mind in which the consciousness of the experiencing subject becomes one with the experienced object. This state is associated with well-practiced meditation.[/li]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"https://iep.utm.edu/aztec/\"]Ancient Aztec philosophy [/ext-link] was largely based on a core concept of [i]teotl[/i], a unifying life-force which created the entire universe from itself, through itself, for itself, and by itself. Therefore, while seemingly separate, all things, including living beings, are ultimately facets of [i]teotl[/i], and are essentially one. [/li]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_feeling\"] Oceanic feeling [/ext-link], a state from Freudian psychology, is described as the sensation of an indissoluble bond of being connected with the external world in its integral form. [/li]\n\n[li][ext-link to=\"http://xenopraxis.net/readings/metzinger_egotunnel.pdf\"] The Ego-Tunnel: The science of the mind and the myth of the self [/ext-link] by Thomas Metzinger discusses the concept of an illusory self from the perspective of modern neuroscience and psychology. This is one of my favourite books in the world and I cannot recomend it enough to those who are interested in a modern and scientific take on some of these concepts.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]I could go on for much longer with this list, but for now I'm going to stop listing examples and just mention that once you become aware of this general philosophical concept, it becomes very difficult to ignore the sheer extent to which it permeates into our culture's media. I've even seen several direct references to it within childrens animated shows.[/p] \n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"PERSONAL COMMENTARY\"]PERSONAL COMMENTARY[/h2]\n[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"][p]Without any question or hesitation, I undoubtedly believe that this particular transpersonal effect is by far the most important and significant state of mind the psychedelic experience has to offer. I have been fascinated by this effect for around a decade now and first came to learn of its existence as a teenager through the numerous first hand accounts given to me by my close friends. This effect was further solidified in my mind as something of extreme significance after I found the works of Alan Watts through his philosophical lectures and writings. I then proceeded to dive headfirst into meditation and obsessively contemplating the supposedly illusory nature of the self on a daily basis. I even found that on more than one occasion, I could lead people into experiencing states of high level unity by simply saying the right words to them during heavy psychedelic trips.  [/p]\n\n[p]However, despite my borderline obsession with this subjective effect and its associated philosophical frameworks, I found that no matter how heavy a dosage of a psychedelic I consumed, I could never experience this state of mind for myself. This led me to the conclusion that regardless of how common an occurrence this effect was for many other experienced psychedelic users, my extreme fascination with it must be the exact thing that is preventing me from experiencing it for myself. Something which caused me to inevitably let my guard down for what was to come. Approximately two years later while under the influence of ayahuasca, I spontaneously found myself undergoing a state of level 4 unity for the first time in my life. This happened on two separate occasions within a month and, at the time, were by far the most profound and lifechanging psychedelic experiences I had ever undergone in my entire life.[/p]\n\n[p]In the years after these two experiences, I have since undergone states of unity on two other occasions, both of which were under the influence of 4-HO-MET and also less than a month apart. These experiences seemingly came out of nowhere and I cannot for the life of me understand or figure out any causal factors or correlations behind the triggering of this state of mind.[/p]\n\n[p]As far as I can tell, it seems that certain individuals are much more prone to it than others, but almost everybody will inevitably experience this if they trip regularly enough over a long period of time. It does not seem to be dependent on the dosage or the psychedelic in question, although set and setting seems to be at least somewhat of a factor. Situations involving beautiful nature, deep contemplation, and philosophical conversation can often cause it to come about, but not in a reliable or reproducible fashion. It therefore seems to me that it must organically arise out of a situation in which the person either comes to a conclusion of their own accord, or perhaps where some subconscious process of the mind is allowed to independently arise in an autonomous manner. [/p]\n\n[p]At this point, I cannot deny that I personally believe the common conception of a separate self is merely a construct of human perception. In fact, I would go even further and state that based upon my extensive research, this widely held position is both philosophically and scientifically justifiable. However, I want to make it clear that I do not have any desire to convince people of that here. Instead, I simply aim to document the subjective experience of this perspective in a manner that is as comprehensive and reasonable as possible. This is with the hope that people far more intelligent than me can someday use this description as a template for furthering our collective understanding of this profound and absolutely fascinating state of mind. [/p]\n[/quote]\n\n[p]If you've made it this far into the video, thanks so much for watching![/p]\n\n[p]Now that I don't need to worry about views or profit motives, I'm starting to find the idea of making content for youtube a lot more fun and interesting again, so unless something changes, I will probably be posting a lot more content over the next several months, starting with a niche but enthusiastic review series on altered state ontologies outside of the Subjective Effect Index.[/p]\n\n[p]If you're looking to join our community and contribute to the field of formalized subjective effect documentation, we do actually have a semi-private but very active discord server and we're always looking for more replicators, artists, creative types, programmers, developers, academics, etc. so if that's something you're interested in, feel free to send me a friend request on discord at the username josikinz#1066.

I have been fascinated by this effect for around a decade now and first came to learn of its existence as a teenager through the numerous first hand accounts given to me by my close friends. This effect was further solidified in my mind as something of extreme significance after I found the works of Alan Watts through his philosophical lectures and writings. I then proceeded to dive headfirst into meditation and obsessively contemplating the supposedly illusory nature of the self on a daily basis. I even found that on more than one occasion, I could lead people into experiencing states of high level unity by simply saying the right words to them during heavy psychedelic trips.  "

This led me to the conclusion that regardless of how common an occurrence this effect was for many other experienced psychedelic users, my extreme fascination with it must be the exact thing that is preventing me from experiencing it for myself. Something which caused me to inevitably let my guard down for what was to come. Approximately two years later while under the influence of ayahuasca, I spontaneously found myself undergoing a state of level 4 unity for the first time in my life. This happened on two separate occasions within a month and, at the time, were by far the most profound and lifechanging psychedelic experiences I had ever undergone in my entire life."

It does not seem to be dependent on the dosage or the psychedelic in question, although set and setting seems to be at least somewhat of a factor. Situations involving beautiful nature, deep contemplation, and philosophical conversation can often cause it to come about, but not in a reliable or reproducible fashion. It therefore seems to me that it must organically arise out of a situation in which the person either comes to a conclusion of their own accord, or perhaps where some subconscious process of the mind is allowed to independently arise in an autonomous manner.
