This is because many people experience an immediate sense of amnesia upon waking up from a dream. For some people, this sense of amnesia results in the details of their dreams being hazy and non-descript, but for others it can result in them being unable to recall any single aspect of their dreams, in a manner which can cause them to believe that they do not dream at all.[/p]\n\n[p]However, this amnesia can be reduced and does not indicate an inherent inability to dream, but simply means that the dreamer's brain does not focus any attention on memorizing them once they are over. The most effective methods of improving memory recall are listed below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Technique 1\" header=\"Dream journals\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]Writing out any and all details within a daily dream log will drastically improve one's ability to recall their dreams. Preferably, this should be done immediately after waking up if possible. The writing style should be in the first person and in the present tense to further improve one's ability to recall the specific plot as it is written down. If there was no dream the previous night, simply write down \"[i]I did not dream last night[/i]\", then continue to use the journal as usual the next day.[/p]\n\n[p]If this is done on a daily basis, it can quickly change the function of the person's memory into one which is attentive to its own dreams.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Technique 2\" header=\"Memory signifiers\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]Many people will often find that when waking up in the middle of the night, they may briefly remember the dream they were having during this state of being half asleep, before waking back up in the morning only to find that they have completely forgotten it.[/p]\n\n[p]If this is the case, during these brief moments of wakefulness for situations such as drinking water or visiting the bathroom, one can make a small change to their environment that will be noticeable in the morning in a manner which then triggers the recollection of the dream. For example, turning a drinking glass upside down or putting an object on one's computer keyboard can act as a powerful memory trigger when seen the next day, allowing one to then write the dream down in their dream journal.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Technique 3\" header=\"Avoiding cannabis before sleep\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]It is common knowledge among cannabis users that it's regular use before bed suppresses one's ability to dream; this phenomenon has been backed up by a study which indicated that smoking marijuana will inhibit REM activity during sleep, therefore suppressing dreams. Once a person stops smoking marijuana before bed, however, REM activity undergoes a rebound effect and dreams will temporarily become much more vivid than usual.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Reality checks[/h2]\n\n[captioned-image src=\"/img/gallery/are you dreaming.jpg\" align=\"right\" border=\"true\" top=\"true\" artist=\"Unknown\" width=\"400\" caption=\"Changing one's desktop wallpaper to this image as a reminder to perform reality checks will greatly improve one's sense of general lucidity.\" /]\n\n[p]To determine whether or not one is dreaming, it is necessary to develop a habit of performing frequent reality checks. A reality check involves asking questions such as \"[i]Am I dreaming?[/i]\" or \"[i]Is this a dream?[/i]\" while performing a specific action which is capable of determining which one of these potential situations is genuinely the case. This works because there are certain actions which can be performed in real life which will not work in the same way within dreams, and can thus be reliably used as a means of testing this possibility.[/p]\n\n[p]So by training oneself to habitually question and test their reality during waking life, the habit will eventually carry over to dreaming life and, ultimately, one will find themselves posing the same questions while dreaming. When this happens and a reality check \"fails\", the odds of the person realizing that they are in a dream becomes inevitable.[/p]\n\n[p]Listed below are some common reality checks that can be used to reliably and effectively determine whether or not one is currently dreaming:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Reality check 1\" header=\"Pushing your finger through your palm\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]During a dream, if a person attempts to push their thumb into the palm of their other hand, it will usually pass straight through the hand and come out the other side in a manner that feels as if the hand is not a truly solid substance. This seemingly holds true when pushing any finger into one's hand. A one handed variant of this check can also be done by clenching one's middle finger into the palm of its same hand.[/p]\n\n[p]However, it is worth noting that although this reality check is very reliable, there are a few accounts of it not working despite the fact that the person trying it was indeed inside of a dream. It is therefore not recommended for use as the person's primary and only form of habitual reality check.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Reality check 2\" header=\"Re-examining text and clocks\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]During a dream, if a person reads text or checks the time on a clock before double taking and re-examining it, upon further scrutiny the information will consistently have been found to have changed, become nonsensical, or become incapable of keeping still.[/p]\n\n[p]This lack of ability to maintain coherent information of this type between the moments in which a person is directly perceiving it, seems to be an inherent limitation behind the way in which dreams are manifested within the brain. It is because of this that re-examining text and clocks is one of the most effortless and reliable of the standard reality checks.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Reality check 3\" header=\"Counting fingers\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]During a dream, if a person look at their hands and attempt to count their fingers, they will quickly realize it is impossible. This is because the number of fingers may keep changing with each count, the hands and fingers may shapeshift and contort into bizarre forms, and the person may find themselves simply unable to retain the number of fingers which they have counted within their short term memory.[/p]\n\n[p]While it is not possible to say for certain, the manner in which this reality check fails to work within dreams feels as if it is directly related to the same inherent limitation which prevents things such as clocks and text maintaining consistency between double takes. It also seems to be a completely reliable and consistent reality check.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Reality check 4\" header=\"Pinching your nose and breathing through it\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]During a dream, if a person tightly pinches their nose shut and attempts to breathe through their nostrils, they will find that they still can as normal. This is presumably because in real life, the person's physical nostrils remain unobstructed while the bodies automatic breathing process continues as normal. For this same reason, breathing through the mouth or nose will always continue as normal even when the dreamer is placed in situations such as being underwater or in outer space.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]For the best results, reality checks should be performed habitually on a frequent and daily basis. For example, good opportunities to perform a reality check during waking life include situations such as every time one walks through a door or enters a new environment, every time one talks to a new person, and every time the situation generally changes in some significant manner. If this is done 10 - 30 times a day, the habit will quickly pass on to one's dreaming life.[/p]\n\n[p]An excellent way to remind oneself to perform reality checks is to put notes containing messages such as \"[i]are you dreaming?[/i]\" or \"[i]perform a reality check[/i]\" in places that one frequently looks at throughout the day. For example, putting a visible note by or on one's computer screen, writing a message on one's hand, changing one's phone wallpaper to the image found above (or something similar), will all greatly improve a person's general lucidity.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Stabilization[/h2]\n[p]Once lucidity has been achieved, many people find that their dream quickly begins to destabilize, collapse, or fade away in a manner that essentially ends the dream. This typically leads the person to either wake up or fall unconscious before losing lucidity and potentially finding themselves back within another non-lucid dream.[/p] \n\n[p]Although frustrating, the sudden destabilization of dreams can easily be overcome by any means which maintains continuous sensory input. This is most commonly achieved via the basic action of continuously rubbing one's hands together while walking around within and exploring the dream space. This stabilization technique can also be further taken advantage of by continuously rubbing one's shoulder with just one of their hands in order to maintain sensory input while freeing up their other hand to use as a tool for interacting with the dream-space.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Activities and control techniques[/h2]\n[p]Once lucidity has been gained and the dream has been stabilized, the dreamer can now begin to practice taking control of the dream and exploring their own mind. Through the power of expecting an action or task to work, almost anything is possible within the dream-space and this can allow for some truly incredible experiences.[/p]\n\n[p]The most common of these activities and the techniques used to engage in them are listed below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 1\" header=\"Enhancing clarity and detail\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]If the dream is blurred and low in clarity or detail, it is possible to enhance and improve these factors by verbally stating aloud \"[i]enhance visual clarity[/i]\" or another similar statement and simply expecting it to work.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 2\" header=\"Spawning objects\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]If the dreamer wants to spawn objects such as vehicles, weapons, food, people, etc, this can be done through two different methods. The first is walking into a room and simply expecting to find the object in a particular location, and the second is drawing the vague shape of the desired object in the air with their hands while simultaneously verbally commanding the object into existence through expectant dialogue such as \"[i]a jetpack is going to appear in front of me.[/i]\" The more specific the verbal request is, the more accurately the object is to fit the dreamers intentions when it spawns.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 3\" header=\"Travelling to new locations\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]If the dreamer wants to travel to a new location, there are two methods through which this can be done. The first of these is to spawn a door by drawing its shape in the air while stating clearly where they would like it to take them before walking through it. An example of this would be the statement \"[i]this door is going to take me to my childhood home[/i]\".[/p] \n\n[p]The second technique is to verbally state where they would like to visit while simultaneously spinning around in circles. Once they have stopped spinning, they should find themselves in the desired location. The more detailed the verbal request, the more accurate the outcome is likely to be.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 4\" header=\"Flying\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]There are different styles of flight that people use, each with a varied level of success depending on the individual. Methods such as swimming through the air as if it were water, “Superman style” (one arm outstretched), “Airplane style” (both arms out), and \"Bird style\" (gliding through the wind, flapping one's arms to navigate air currents) are often used.[/p]\n\n[p]Regardless of the flight style, there are a few methods of getting up into the air, such as jumping or willing one's body to levitate. However, perhaps the easiest method of flight is to use a flying tool that the dreamer pre-emptively spawns in, such as a jet-pack or witches broomstick.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 5\" header=\"Shape-shifting\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]Many people try to shape-shift into animals, creatures, and other genders by willfully changing their body parts one by one. This is usually ineffective, as the body often changes back quicker than one can complete the process. A much more effective technique is to turn the transformation into an instant process by spawning a tool which will help one to transform. An example of this would be to spawn a magical transformation pill which can be swallowed or a magical wand which can be waved in order to instantly transform one into their desired form.[/p]\n\n[p]Another surprisingly effective shape-shifting technique is to posses the body of an already existing person, animal or creature. This can be done through the bizarre but simple method of climb into them from behind and wearing their body over one's own skin in a manner that is similar to that of a wet-suit.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 6\" header=\"Having sex\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]Although it is potentially a somewhat taboo topic, many people learn to lucid dream purely for sexual reasons. This can often be unexpectedly difficult, as it is often very challenging to maintain lucidity during the act of dream sex and the chosen partner may even shift into an undesirable form part way through. However, in order to have sex within a lucid dream, all one needs to do is simply initiate it with a dream character.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 7\" header=\"Taking drugs\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]An interesting way to change the course of the dream is to ingest drugs which the dreamer may or may not have tried in real life. This will result in inducing a variety of unique and unexpected changes to the dreamers mood and perception, which may or may not line up with the effects which the real life substance actually induces.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 8\" header=\"Eating food\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]Another great activity to engage in within dreams is the simple act of eating food. This is because the experience of eating food within a dream can feel and taste completely realistic, resulting in an extremely pleasurable experience which is genuinely very satisfying.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Alternative/Advanced techniques[/h2]\n[p]Outside of the more common and standard technique of habitually practicing reality checks in order to obtain lucidity within dreams, there are a number of advance and alternative techniques that can be used for similar purposes. Listed below are just a few of the most common advance techniques, each with links to more detailed tutorials that are hosted on other websites.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"FILD\" header=\"Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]FILD (Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming)[/i] is defined as the act of waking up from deep sleep in the middle of the night, before performing light repetitive movements with your fingers as if you were playing the piano with your index and middle finger, and then allowing the body to drift off to sleep while this action is being performed. This process usually lasts for several seconds to a few minutes, but if performed successfully it can allow the person to enter into a dream state while still remaining fully conscious.[/p] \n\n[p]A much more detailed instructional tutorial can be found within this article [ext-link to=\"https://www.thelucidguide.com/Techniques/Finger%2FFocus-Induced-Lucid-Dream-%28FILD%29]here[/ext-link].[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"WILD\" header=\"Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]WILD (Wake Initiated Lucid Dream)[/i] was coined by Dr. Stephen LaBerge, a psychophysiologist who specialized in the study of dreams.

Depending on the person's level of experience, the effects can be allowed to occupy a predominant role within the person's perception, or they may be ignored and made somewhat secondary to other chosen activities. At this level, people are typically able to engage in regular behaviours and maintain the ability to communicate properly, though there will likely be noticeable impairments in concentration and short term memory that may be overcome with effort.

The absence of such terminology has limited our ability to fully understand our own experiences and made discussion and research in this domain difficult. People who have noticed this absence have been driven to volunteer countless hours of their free time to document their experiences and coin, define, and categorize terms, ultimately culminating in the Subjective Effect Index.[/p] \n\n[p]Effect Index is the website that hosts the [ext-link to=\"https://www.effectindex.com/effects\"]Subjective Effect Index[/ext-link] (SEI), a database of 233 effect descriptions that strives to serve as a comprehensive map of all potential experiences that can occur under the influence of any class of psychoactive compound, particularly hallucinogens. The existing SEI has been increasingly used to facilitate discussion within online psychedelic spaces since around 2012. However, it has not yet reached a level of completeness and polish that would allow it to serve as a universal terminology set. By improving and completing the SEI, we intend to create a tool that will improve our collective ability to research altered states of consciousness and greatly enhance the academic, clinical, therapeutic, personal, and cultural relevance of psychoactive compounds.[/p]\n\n[p]Under the employment of [ext-link to=\"https://www.mindstate.design/\"]Mindstate Design Labs[/ext-link], a Y Combinator startup, I am leading a project to develop a new version of the SEI with unparalleled comprehensiveness and academic rigor.

It will incorporate a comprehensive literature review of other rudimentary altered state of consciousness ontologies, such as psychometric tools and informal classification systems found within books and online resources. We intend for this project to be fully open source so that it can become a ubiquitous resource analogous to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, providing a defined common lexicon so that researchers and laypeople alike can discuss altered states of consciousness in a succinct yet meaningful way.[/p]\n\n[p]Thanks to my employers, the creation of this particular aspect of the project is already underway. However, new funding will be needed to integrate the improved SEI into the Effect Index website and empower the Subjective Effect Documentation community to continue improving the index in our ever-evolving world.

We would like to implement:\n[ul listStyle=\"square\"]\n[li]A way to change the order of replications on user pages so that they are better suited for use as portfolios.[/li]\n[li]A way to better manage the categories of user pages, and the order of the users in them.[/li]\n[li]Simplified trip report submission to our report index. Reports would then undergo moderation and manual approval before being integrated into the Subjective Effect Index via the effect tagging process.[/li]\n[li]Upgrading the user interface to allow direct upload of images, videos, gifs, and audio files without resorting to an external FTP client. This would allow replicators and visionary artists to submit their own content easily to relevant effect pages and prevent changes in third-party services from disabling community assets.[/li]\n[li]Upgrading the trip report editor to fix numerous issues to make writing trip reports easier, as well as making trip reports easier for machine learning to process and reliably analyze. These changes include the input fields needing to be more strict with the values they accept, as well as converting between units for the user. The medications list should also be a separate list of meds and dosages, similar to how the substances box works. A more consistent time format would help with readability and ML processing. The editor should also strip whitespace around input fields.[/li]\n[li]A live preview for the VCode editor would be immensely helpful, especially for large content and formatting-dense articles.[/li]\n[li]These changes would take an estimated 190 hours to add (~$5130 USD).[/li][/ul][/li]\n\n[li][i]Structural improvements:[/i] To remain a relevant resource, the website should be upgraded to accommodate the following:\n[ul listStyle=\"square\"]\n[li]The newest edition of the Subjective Effect Index is being developed under Josie Kins’ work with Mind State Design Labs, and we should have the website fully prepared for the new effects and general overarching structure of the ontology by the time it is published and available to the public.[/li]\n[li]A directory of other Altered State of Consciousness Ontologies, with direct comparison to the Subjective Index. This will essentially be a user-facing showcase of the literature review that Josikinz is already working on with Mind State Design Labs.[/li]\n[li]These changes would take an estimated 180 hours to add (~$4860 USD).[/li][/ul][/li]\n\n[li]Ideally as many pages outside of effects, articles, etc, should be editable within the UI of the website to the maximum extent that is practically possible. This will take inspiration from the way in which MediaWiki allows people to do much the same thing.\n[ul listStyle=\"square\"]\n[li]We’ll need to make embeddable vcode components for a wider array of site features: tabs, read more button, tabs for viewing multiple versions of an article or article section\nallow creation / editing of arbitrary pages with vcode[/li]\n[li]changing an article's icon in the web editor[/li]\n[li]We need version control for articles, much like with MediaWiki. This would allow us to track edits and revert changes more easily. Something which is essential for giving people more editor privileges.\n[li]These changes would take an estimated 160 hours to add (~$4320 USD).[/li][/li][/ul][/li]\n\n[li]A function for redirecting effects to other effects or webpages, so you create an effect that essentially serves an alternative title which people may search for. (~10h / $270)[/li]\n[li]Implement timestamps into the error log.[/li]\n[li]Automatic citation generation in a set format would make managing citations easier, as well as preferring DOIs. (~20h / $540)[/li]\n[li]Some things such as the “project” tab could have a scrolling TOC on the side? Discuss. (~30h / $810)[/li]\n[li]The “About Us” button on the page only displays after hitting “read more”. Most people probably won’t click “read more”. This is a small thing but should absolutely be fixed.[/li]\n[li]Implementing analytics to see what pages people interact with / how they interact with them (eg, what elements are clicked the most?) would be helpful when designing articles to see which elements convey information better, and so on. (~50h / $1350)[/li]\n[li]A discord bot to post updates / help manage the EI (eg, when someone submits a new trip report).  (~20h / $540)[/li]\n[li] The main page should be overhauled with new information and content, as well as phrasing such as “Hallucinogenic substance classes” being updated to use modern language. (~15h / $405)[/li]\n[li]A way to search through all articles / vcode components for text, to aide in updating content and fixing references to broken components. (~30h / $810)[/li]\n[li]Proper error handling and status codes from the API, instead of returning 500 for everything. (~30h / $810)[/li]\n[li]Embeddable gif support in the image viewer. (~15h / $405)[/li]\n[li]Articles that were published before the publish date system was added are missing a publish date. Adding a box to manually enter a date would be ideal. (~5h / $135)[/li]\n[/ul]\n[ul listStyle=\"circle\"]\n[li][i]Article and report editing improvements:[/i] We would like to implement various goals in order to make the creation and editing of content on the Effect Index easier and faster for editors.[/li]\n[ul listStyle=\"square\"]\n[li]Article formatting templates, to make creating standardised articles easier. (~15h / $675)[/li]\n[li]Fixing bugs and issues with the editor, such as visual issues with regards to account permissions. (~11h / $297)[/li]\n[li]A live preview for the VCode editor, and showing the article side-by-side instead of a tabbed view would make editing formatting easier.[/li]\n[li]A component for showing substance durations and dosages would be nice to have, when referencing a specific substance.[/li]\n[li]Inline citation links would be great (similar to mediawiki). The current css for them should also be more aesthetically pleasing. Currently the citations are too big and with too much space around them. (~30h / $810)[/li]\n[li]Overhaul the replication gallery. I would prefer to have not just the option for slideshows, but collections of tiled thumbnails for a more presentable showcasing. (~60h / $1620)[/li]\n[li]Tickboxes for managing profile roles, and managing effect tags rather than freestanding boxes would make site management easier.

Although the content and purpose of dreams are not well understood, they have been a topic of philosophical and religious interest throughout much of recorded history. There is also solid scientific evidence that dreams are a common occurrence throughout the lives of not just most human beings, but many other animals as well.[/p]\n\n[p]This article is meant to serve as a companion piece to our [int-link to=\"/articles/lucid-dreaming\"]lucid dreaming[/int-link] article, which focuses on serving as an informational guide for learning to consistently gain a stable sense of lucidity within one's own dreams, as well as the instructional techniques for utilizing and harnessing further control of the dream once this has been achieved. Instead of detailing lucid dreaming techniques, however, this article will attempt to comprehensively document the subjective effects that occur during dream states by breaking them down into their individual sub-components while providing detailed descriptions and leveling systems wherever possible.[/p]\n\n[p]At [i]lower levels[/i], dreams typically manifest as imagery on the back of a person's eyelids, which do not take up the entirety of one's visual field and are distinct from their background. These can be described as spontaneous moving or still images of scenes, concepts, places, or anything one could imagine. The imagery is manifested in varying levels of realism ranging from ill-defined and cartoon-like to wholly realistic. They rarely hold their form for more than a few seconds before fading or shifting into another image. This level typically occurs while the person is either in the process of falling asleep or waking up.[/p]\n\n[p]At [i]higher levels[/i], however, dreams become increasingly elaborate as they eventually become all-encompassing, fully-fledged 3D scenes that surround the person in a similar manner to that of the [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] that can occur under the influences of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic substances. This level typically occurs when the person is in deep sleep.[/p]\n\n[p]In a more comprehensive level of detail, the clarity and immersiveness at which dreams presents themselves can be broken down into the 5 different levels of intensity described below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Enhancement of mental visualization\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]At the lowest level, dreams can be defined as the distinct enhancement of mental visualisation that a person drifts into while daydreaming or using their imagination. It can be described as a short-term detachment from one’s immediate surroundings; during which, a person’s contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by an ill-defined fantasy. The details of this internal visualisation are chosen in a slightly spontaneous or autonomous nature, but are mostly consciously controlled by the content of one’s current thought stream.[/p]\n\n[p]This level is extremely common and often occurs while a person is falling asleep (hypnagogia), while a person is waking up (hypnapompia), and also during general waking consciousness.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]At this level, dreams consist of partially defined, blurred, and faded imagery within a person’s visual field. This is where the content of these dreams usually becomes more spontaneous in nature and out of the person’s conscious control.[/p]\n\n[p]This level is commonly experienced as a person begins to fall asleep. However, it is much less of a universal experience than that of fully fledged dream states.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]At this level, the vividness and intensity increases in a fashion that renders the imagery seen within one’s visual field as fully defined and realistic in its appearance.[/p]\n\n[p]This level is commonly experienced as a person begins to fall asleep. However, it is less of a universal experience than that of fully fledged dream states.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]At this level, the vividness, scope, and intensity of the dream becomes all-encompassing in a way that displays momentary flashes of scenes that surround the person in an immersive environment. Although all-encompassing, they are often very blurred and ill defined in appearance. Additionally, the dreamer's physical body will often still feel at least partially connected to the real world. Other senses, such as touch, taste, and smell, may also be extremely vague or entirely absent.[/p]\n\n[p]This level is commonly experienced during short naps, during the moments of lapsed consciousness that can occur as a result of sleep deprivation, and during states of shallow restless sleep that is being disturbed by suboptimal sleeping conditions.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]At the highest level, dreams further increase to become all-encompassing in a manner that displays long-lasting scenes surrounding the person with an explorable and fully immersive environment. This occurs in a fashion that is fully detailed and highly vivid in its appearance. Typically, it also occurs alongside relevant auditory and tactile sensations.[/p]\n\n[p]This level is commonly experienced during states of deep REM (rapid eye movement), which occurs after approximately 90 minutes of sleep.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]The perception of time in hallucinatory dream scenarios typically feel as if they are being experienced in real-time, which means that if 20 seconds are perceived to have passed within the dream the same amount of time will have elapsed in the real world. However, it is also possible for time distortions to occur, resulting in scenarios and plots that can feel as if they last days, weeks, or even an infinite amount of time.[/p]\n\n[p]The content and behaviour of dreams can be further broken down into six distinct subcomponents. These are described and documented within their own dedicated subsections, each of which are listed below.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Scenarios and plots[/h2]\n[p]The [i]scenarios and plots[/i] that occur within dream are challenging to define in a truly comprehensive manner in much the same way that we cannot really predict the plot of literature or films. However, they generally involve a heavy emphasis on themes and concepts which hold some level of emotional significance to the dreamer or at least occurred within recent memory. However, despite this emphasis, there is also a powerful element of randomness to these plots which can lead these scenarios in a wild variety of directions.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of coherency, scenarios and plots can be linear, with events that occur in a logical sequence and lead into each other through clear cause and effect. Equally likely, however, are scenarios and plots that present themselves as muddled, nonsensical, and incoherent. The plots themselves can also either be entirely new experiences that are unlike anything experienced within the real world, such as the visitation of fantastical worlds or the use of magical powers. Alternatively, old experiences such as the reliving of past memories are also entirely possible. Usually, however, dreams are some combination of these two extremes, such as the visitation of real life locations from the dreamers waking life, combined with meeting strangers, or experiencing fantastical events.[/p]\n\n[p]Regardless of thematic and situational content, dreams are usually accompanied by an uncontrollable sense of plot acceptance. This results in the dreamer almost always accepting any plot within their dream as an entirely real event in which the results of their actions are likely to have genuine consequences, regardless of how absurd and unrealistic the situation may be. When this sense of plot acceptance is overcome, it can result in state known as \"lucid dreaming\". Which is a well documented phenomena that involves the person becoming actively aware of the fact that they are dreaming and with practice, can even take full control of what happens inside of it.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Setting[/h2]\n[p]At levels 4 and 5 dreams consistently manifest themselves through extremely detailed imaginary landscapes, locations, and sceneries of potentially infinite variety. These exist to act as the setting in which the plot of the dream occurs. The geography of these settings is capable of rendering itself as static and coherent in organization, but will usually result in a non-linear, nonsensical, and continuously changing layout which do not obey the laws of physics. The specific locations within these settings appear to be selected at random, and are often entirely new locations that have not been visited in real life. However, there is also often a heavy emphasis on replicating and combining real life locations stored within a person's memories, especially those which are prominent in their daily life or past.[/p]\n\n[p]Within these dreamscapes, relevant and irrelevant objects of any sort typically populate the setting in much the same way that they would in real life. These can usually be interacted with in the same way that any real life object can be, but may react in unexpected and spontaneous ways. Some common examples of this may include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li]Objects such as books, clocks, or anything with text on them being incapable of rendering static information that does not reset and change as soon as the dreamer double takes.[/li]\n  [li]Cars being driveable, but being extremely difficult to control in comparison to their real life equivalents.[/li]\n  [li]Bodies of water remaining breathable, even when the dreamer is completely submerged under them.[/li]\n  [li]Electronic devices such as computers and phones not being fully responsive or functional.[/li]\n  [li]Mirrors displaying incredibly distorted reflections which progressively shapeshift when stared upon.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Dream characters[/h2]\n[p]Throughout the settings of almost any dream, the scenery is often inhabited and populated by [i]dream characters[/i]. These are entities which act autonomous in their behaviour and are capable of communicating through spoken word. They are usually felt and presumed to be living inhabitants of the environment in which the dream is set. They also interact with the dreamer in various ways, are usually completely unaware that they are the inhabitants of a dream, and are typically unsurprised by the dreamers appearance.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of their appearance, dream characters can show themselves as literally anything but will usually display themselves as perfectly ordinary people. These people are equally likely to be complete strangers or randomly selected people which the dreamer has encountered throughout their life. The more prominent and emotionally significant the person is, the more likely they are to be encountered within the dreamscape.[/p]\n\n[p]When communicated with through spoken word the level of coherency in which these entities can reply with is highly variable but can be broken down into 4 distinct levels of communication:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Silence\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, communcation can be described as a complete unresponsiveness from the entity and a lack of speech despite their presence within the dream.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, communication can be described as linguistic conversational responses and noises that almost sound like words but do not contain any real content or meaning beyond a vague sense of emotional intent.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, communication can be described as audible linguistic conversational responses and noises that contain fully defined and understandable words, but often lack grammatical structure or an overall sense of general coherency.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, communication can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain fully defined and understandable words with a partially defined grammatical structure and general coherency. It conveys its point on a level that is frequently coherent, but may not always be fully understandable and will sometimes descend into broken grammar or even gibberish.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the highest level, communication can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain understandable words and fully defined grammatical sentence structures. It has an overall sense of general coherency, which conveys its point in a level of detail that is genuinely on par with that of a person’s own intellect.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Perspectives[/h2]\n[p]The perspective in which dreams are perceived through can be broken down into through the four alternative vantage points described below:[/p]\n[ul]\n[li][b]1st person[/b] - The most common dream perspective, which can be described as the standard experience of perceiving the scenario from the perspective of a person's everyday self and body.[/li]\n[li][b]2nd person[/b] - This perspective can be described as the experience of seeing the dream from the viewpoint of an external source of consciousness, such as another person, an animal, or an inanimate object.[/li]\n[li][b]3rd person[/b] - This perspective is similar to an out-of-body experience and can be described as perceiving a dream from a perspective which is floating above, below, behind, or in front of the dreamer's physical body. It is worth noting that for unknown reasons many people consistently and exclusively dream in the third person perspective.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Amnesia[/h2]\n[p]Once a person has woken up from their dream, they will often find that their memory of what happened within the dream quickly begins to fade. This amnesia varies in its intensity from person to person, with some people never remembering their dreams and others remembering their dreams almost every single night. However, dream related amnesia can be combatted using techniques such as immediately writing in a dream journal upon waking up, and generally making a conscious effort to regularly pay more attention to one's own dreams.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]See Also[/h2]\n[ul]\n[li][int-link to=\"/effects\"]Subjective Effect Index[/int-link][/li]\n[li][int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]Internal hallucination[/int-link][/li]\n[li][int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]Autonomous entity[/int-link][/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[h3]External links[/h3]\n[ul]\n[li][ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream\"]Dream (Wikipedia)[/ext-link][/li]\n[li][ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream\"]Lucid dream (Wikipedia)[/ext-link][/li]\n[/ul]",[3069,28,3077,28,3086,28,3095,28,3108,28,3112,28,3125,28,3137,28,3150,28,3162,28,3174,28,3178,28,3182,28,3184,48,3188,28,3197,28,3201,28,3205,28,3207,48,3211,28,3215,28,3219,28,3243,28,3245,48,3249,28,3258,28,3262,28,3266,28,3271,28,3276,28,3281,28,3286,28,3291,28,3293,48,3297,48,3301,28,3328,28,3330,48,3334,28,3338,28,3340,48,3343,28,3364,48,3367],{"name":11,"properties":3070,"children":3071},{},[3072,3076],{"name":16,"properties":3073,"children":3074},{},[3075],"Dreams"," are defined as the succession of hallucinatory images, scenarios, ideas, emotions, and sensations that occur involuntarily within the mind during certain stages of sleep.

However, it is worth noting that dissociative geometry rarely exceeds level 4 and is generally far more simplistic and colourless than that of its psychedelic counterpart.\nThis is the level at which the effects become powerful enough to render the person undergoing them as incapable of functioning, interacting normally, or thinking in a sober manner. At this level, the effects of the substance are clear and can no longer be ignored in any capacity, leaving the user entirely engaged in the experience whether they wish to be or not.

Eventually we will employ a small team ingesting psychoactive substances at a range of dosages, who will document their experiences through the use of standardized [int-link to=\"/reports/\"]trip reports[/int-link] using our [ext-link to=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/1VdkmHgkng78fPrpqIFd7qDti5B7ml_oD8ZFiHbid8w0/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true\"]SEI form system[/ext-link]. We will then analyse this collected data in order to further detail and substantiate which effects are induced at specific dosage ranges, their levels of intensity, style, and approximate frequency of occurrence.[/p]\n\n[p]DMT is a smokable [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/visual\"]psychedelic hallucinogen[/int-link] within the tryptamine chemical class. It is also found as a naturally occurring endogenous byproduct within a huge variety of plants and animals, [ext-link to=\"https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/dta.422\"]including humans[/ext-link]. The substance itself induces a brief but extremely intense psychedelic experience, alongside a disproportionate amount of hallucinatory content in comparison to other traditional psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, and mescaline.[/p]\n\n[p]This article exclusively discusses DMT’s subjective effects. If you would like to learn more about DMT's chemistry, pharmacology, history, legality, and potential dangers, refer to its PsychonautWiki article [ext-link to=\"https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT\"]here[/ext-link].[/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Duration[/h2]\n[ul]\n[li][b]Total :[/b] 5 - 20 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Onset :[/b] 20 - 40 seconds[/li]\n[li][b]Come up :[/b] 1 - 3 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Peak :[/b] 2 - 8 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Offset :[/b] 1 - 6 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]After effects :[/b] 10 - 60 minutes[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]These durations only apply to DMT that is being smoked or vaporised. DMT is not active through oral ingestion unless an MAOI or an RIMA (such as syrian rue or B. caapi vine) is consumed approximately 30 - 60 minutes prior to DMT. This substantially changes the subjective effect profile of the compound, so much that it is usually discussed as distinct experience: “Ayahuasca” is DMT prepared for oral ingestion using traditional plant sources, while “pharmahuasca” colloquially refers to preparations made with crystalized DMT or psychiatric/synthetic MAOIs.[/p]\n\n[p]Besides vaporizing and oral ingestion, less effective (and consequently less common) routes of administration include insufflation, rectal suppository, and sublingual absorption. In clinical settings, DMT is typically administered intravenously, which can allowed for a prolonged immersive hallucinatory state. Recreational intravenous use is also uncommon as it requires medical equipment, training, and pharmaceutical-grade DMT.[/p]\n\n[p]The duration of a DMT trip seems to progress through four separate stages of experience that each feel distinct. At heavy dosages the user may find themselves progressing through all of these stages in sequence, while low-dose experiences may skip over stages 2 or 3. These stages are described and documented below.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Taking off\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"chart-line.svg\"]\n[p]The first stage of a DMT trip is the onset, which leads into what is commonly referred to as \"breaking through\".[/p]\n\n[p]As the user smokes DMT, effects typically begins with the sudden onset of distinct [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-enhancements\"]visual enhancements[/int-link], which are immediately followed by high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] and a [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]warm tingling sensation[/int-link]. At higher dosages, the user may find the pipe that they are using to smoke their DMT has transformed into an incomprehensible mass of geometry that is quite difficult to put down or hand off to someone nearby. There may also be [int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-hallucination\"]auditory hallucinations[/int-link] that resemble soft crackling. For example, some users report an extended tone that quickly rises in volume and pitch as the intensity of [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-effects\"]visual effects[/int-link] also increases.[/p]\n\n[p]This sound (which is replicated above) typically becomes all-enveloping and abruptly ends as one of several different “take off” variations are experienced. These include, but are not limited to:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li]Increasingly intense [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link], which becomes so all-enveloping that the visible environment is completely blocked out and replaced.[/li]\n[li]Feelings of being suddenly pushed through – and onto – the other side of a membrane.[/li]\n[li]The environment forming into a geometry-filled tunnel, which the user moves into as it widens and subsequently encompasses their entire vision.[/li]\n[li]The environment splitting into separated sections, leaving a gaping chasm filled with high-level geometry as the user separates from their body and is then catapulted directly into it at a high speed.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]This process of \"taking off\" typically occurs within the range of about 30 seconds to a minute, and leads directly onto the second stage of a DMT trip.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 2\" header=\"The Waiting Room\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"hourglass.svg\"]\n[p]Almost immediately after a person has smoked enough DMT to “[i]take off[/i]”, they sometimes find themselves spending approximately 10 - 30 seconds in what is often described as a psychedelic “[i]waiting room[/i]”. It can take on any appearance, but most commonly presents itself as a tunnel, room, or space that is comprised of fast moving [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]In fact, this \"waiting room\" feels distinctively different from the main bulk of the trip to such an extent that it has led many DMT users to speculate that it is potentially some sort of psychedelic loading screen, during which the upcoming trip is being generated and planned out by the subconscious mind.[/p]\n\n[p]After “taking off”, the person will usually transition into the most impressive stage of the experience. However, in certain cases the user may feel stuck within the waiting room, and may even experience hallucinatory [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] suggesting that they are not yet ready to proceed past it. It is also important to note that although still relatively common in its occurrence, the waiting room is the least consistent stage of a DMT trip, and many users will never experience it all while simply finding that their DMT trips skip over it.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 3\" header=\"The Other Side\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"geometry.svg\"]\n[p]Once the waiting room stage is either finished or skipped over, the user will feel that they have broken through into what is commonly referred to as the \"other side\". It is here where an incredibly wide variety of potential hallucinatory content can manifest itself. However, this intensified stage will still usually follow somewhat consistent themes and archetypes that are reported by many people who experience the substance.[/p]\n\n[p]These themes generally consist of visiting a hallucinated alternate reality that is sometimes reported to feel \"more real\" than everyday life. In terms of their visual aesthetic, these hallucinatory spaces usually consist of incomprehensibly complex psychedelic [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] that is condensed into [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]settings or scenes[/int-link]. Examples of DMT spaces include landscapes, fractalscapes, rooms, buildings, cities, tunnels, caverns, non-euclidean structures resembling a hive or nest, womb-like environments, and an infinite variety of potential others.[/p]\n\n[p]Within DMT spaces, there are often one or more [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link] within the user's perceived field of vision. These entities frequently act as if they have been waiting for the user's arrival, and are usually unphased by the person's sudden apparition. Upon noticing the user, DMT entities may enthusiastically greet them but reactions of surprise, indifference, or ambivalence are equally common. These entities may also convey a sense of urgency, as though attempting to demonstrate a multitude of incredible things during the short amount of time that they have before the effects of the drug wear off.[/p]\n\n[p]During these experiences, [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] may employ a variety of [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity?s=communication-styles\"]communnication styles[/int-link], including: [i]spoken language, direct manipulation of the visual environment, choreographed movement, telepathy, beams of energy or information, visual languages, or any combination of these[/i]. Through means such as these, entities often seemingly attempt to either explain some message to the user, or provide a guided tour of some aspect of the [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link] which they inhabit. The message often feels personalized and related to the user's life or emotional well-being, but can also contain aspects that seem entirely nonsensical or ineffable when removed from the context of the DMT trip.[/p]\n\n[p]These [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] will often dubiously present themselves as all-knowing, and although they can take any visual form, some visual archetypes are more commonly experienced. These archetypes include [i]humanoids, aliens, elves, insectoids, giant spheres, beings of light, plants, jesters, maternal or nurturing guardians, and complex robotic machines[/i]. At this point it is common for the user (unless they are very experienced) to be completely overwhelmed by the DMT trip, despite feeling relatively clear-headed. This sometimes results in the entities encouraging the user to stay calm, not to give into astonishment, and to simply try to pay attention to what is happening.[/p]\n\n[p]Although they are common, it is worth noting that these [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entity[/int-link]-filled [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]hallucinatory spaces[/int-link] do not necessarily occur for every person and are not entirely consistent in their manifestation between trips. A certain number of people do not seem to experience hallucinations at all, and instead simply find themselves engulfed in all-encompassing high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] during this stage of the DMT trip. Thus, the frequency with which any given user encounters entity-filled DMT spaces varies.[/p]\n\n[p]After 2 - 10 minutes of this experience, the DMT trip will begin to wear off while moving into its fourth and final stage.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 4\" header=\"Coming Down\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"chart-line-down.svg\"]\n[p]The final stage concludes the trip, with either the sensation of being pulled progressively further away from the [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link], or the hallucinations becoming increasingly vague and ill-defined until imperceptible. During this process, the [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] will sometimes bid farewell and encourage the person to return if given the chance.[/p]\n\n[p]Once over, the user immediately finds themselves back in reality with strong level 4 - 5 visual [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] which quickly fades. Similar to how the content of a dream is commonly forgotten upon waking up, detailed memories of DMT experiences also often rapidly deteriorate upon returning to baseline consciousness. This [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link] can be counteracted by taking notes, recounting the trip to another person in detail, recording a narration of the experience on audio or video, or using other such method.[/p]\n\n[p]As the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] becomes more mild and [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link] sets in, the user will often experience a sense of being [int-link to=\"/effects/physical-euphoria\"]bathed in euphoria and awe[/int-link]. The geometry typically persists for an additional 5 - 10 minutes before disappearing completely, leaving a strong [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]body high[/int-link] that can persist for up to half an hour in extreme cases. This afterglow typically feels like a warm fuzziness throughout the body, and often leaves behind a sense of cognitive [int-link to=\"/effects/rejuvenation\"]rejuvenation[/int-link], well-being, and mental clarity which can last for hours, days, or even weeks after the trip.[/p]\n\n[p]However, it is worth noting that if the user has consumed a dosage that is not strong enough to reach stages two and three, then this experience of coming down will simply manifest as a progressive reduction of intensity without any of the aforementioned effects or details.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n[h2]Intensity Scale[/h2]\n[p]This intensity scale breaks the subjective effects of DMT into six distinct levels, in which each level typically contains an expanding list of effects that generally intensify relative to the dosage consumed.

At higher doses, this geometry is significantly more likely to result in states of [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-exposure-to-inner-mechanics-of-consciousness\"]visual exposure to the inner mechanics of consciousness[/int-link] rather than a [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-exposure-to-semantic-concept-network\"]visual exposure to one's semantic concept network[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]It is also worth noting that the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] induced by vaporized DMT is widely considered to be the most profoundly intricate and complex manifestation of this effect out of any and all psychedelic drugs. Compared to the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry?s=variations\"]style of geometry[/int-link] produced by ayahuasca, the geometry appears more synthetic and digital in material composition, demonstrates colour schemes that are similar to those experienced on LSD, and has an organized geometric structure reminiscent of that produced by psilocybin.[/p]\n\n[p]At this level, spontaneous tactile sensations become pronounced and fully manifested. The [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations?s=variations\"]style variations of these bodily sensations[/int-link] includes [i]a constant duration, feelings of movement, gentle character, all-encompassing placement, and euphoric emotion[/i]. This sensation typically maintains a consistent presence that quickly rises with the onset and hits a limit once the peak has been reached. It is capable of becoming very powerful at higher doses and can sometimes persist for up to half an hour after the experience itself has ended.[/p]\n\n[p]Although they are substantially less common than internal hallucinations, [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link] can also occasionally occur with heavy doses of DMT. These typically consist of a mixture of realistic and [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link]-based hallucinations of either real objects within the surrounding environment \"[int-link to=\"/effects/object-activation\"]coming to life[/int-link])\", the entirety of the environment changing in its visual character, or sudden apparitions such as the appearance of [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link]. The [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination?s=variations\"]style variations[/int-link] of these external hallucinations is [i]lucid awareness, an immersed viewpoint, novel subject matter, autonomous and non-controllable, and equally likely to be either realistic in appearance or comprised of psychedelic geometry[/i]. Although external hallucinations are more common under the influence of DMT in comparison to other psychedelics, they are still quite uncommon and may never be experienced even by regular users.[/p]\n\n[p]During a distinct DMT experience, the effects and the nature of the substance become well-defined enough that ignoring its effects is difficult. However, the user is still enough in control to be able to just about partake in normal behaviours, remain functional, and be able to communicate. Depending on the person's level of experience, the effects can be allowed dominate the user’s perception, or they may be ignored and made secondary to other chosen activities.[/p]\n\n[p]At most, a distinct DMT trip may result in a well-defined \"take off\" followed by an ill-defined version of the \"waiting room\", while entirely skipping over stage three.

The user typically feels like they have broken through into the hallucinatory [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link], as previously described in the \"[i]other side[/i]\" section of this video.[/p]\n\n[p]For most people, a strong dose of DMT will produce high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] more consistently than any other psychedelic. The style variations of these internal hallucinations is that they are usually [i]lucid in awareness, interactive, novel in subject, autonomous and non-controllable, and psychedelic in appearance[/i]. This is accompanied by other hallucinatory effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]sceneries and landscapes[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]narrative scenarios[/int-link]. These hallucinations can involve an endless variety of themes that may be personal, religious, spiritual, futuristic, magical, surreal, nonsensical, or transcendental in nature.[/p]\n\n[p]It's also worth mentioning that during the onset of this intensity range and above, the user will often experiences [int-link to=\"/effects/changes-in-felt-gravity\"]changes in their perception of gravity[/int-link] which commonly involve feelings of floating at extreme speeds either forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards, or in an unspecifiable direction. This will usually stop once the user has reached their \"destination\" but will often continue at a much slower pace if the hallucination involves moving around within a specific location.[/p]\n\n[p]Despite intense hallucinations at this dosage range, the user will often still feel partially connected to their physical body even while traversing [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]hallucinatory spaces[/int-link]. Most users will also automatically close their eyes and allow themselves to be immersed in the internal experience – however, if the user suddenly opens their eyes midway through the trip, they will likely leave the hallucinatory space. Upon interrupting their [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], the user will typically experience much less-intense [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-effects\"]visual effects[/int-link] with their eyes open. These effects typically include strong [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-distortions\"]visual distortions[/int-link] and highly complex [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] that almost completely cover the user's field of view. Upon closing their eyes again, the user may find themselves placed directly back into the same [int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]hallucinatory scenario[/int-link], or they may simply experience high-level geometry while being unable to completely re-enter their internal hallucination.[/p]\n\n[p]During less intense DMT breakthroughs experienced at this dosage range, many users report feeling surprisingly lucid and clear-headed in comparison to an equally-intense dose of psilocybin, mescaline, or LSD. However, the insightful and therapeutic cognitive effects that are heavily associated with psychedelic experiences are frequently either entirely absent or significantly reduced. This may be a result of DMT's extremely short duration, which does not allow the person much time to deeply contemplate or experience its cognitive effects.[/p]\n\nIf the user is inexperienced with psychedelic substances while undergoing this dosage range or above, they may find themselves experiencing [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety\"]anxiety[/int-link] and fear throughout the duration of the trip. This is not because DMT is inherently anxiety-inducing, but is more likely a response to being thrust into a profoundly complex, bizarre, overwhelming, and unfamiliar situation. As with any hallucinogen, it is always safest to slowly increase an inexperienced person's dosage in small increments over the course of multiple trips, and at a rate which the user is comfortable with. \n\n[p]A strong DMT experience is powerful enough to render the user mostly incapable of functioning normally, social interactions, or thinking in a sober manner. At this level of intensity, the effects of the substance are obvious and cannot be ignored in any capacity, leaving the user completely engaged in the experience whether they wish to be or not.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of its stages, a strong DMT trip will usually result in all four stages of the experience, but with the \"other side\" being distinctly present – although it will still become more defined at higher dosages.

characterised by a complete [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]loss of the user's sense of self or ego[/int-link]. The user not only feels as though they have broken through to the “[i]other side[/i]” of the [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link], but that they have also [int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression\"]lost any ability to recall[/int-link] and comprehend even the most fundamental concepts in their long-term memory. These concepts can include everything from their name, hometown, memories, the awareness of being on drugs, what drugs even are, what human beings are, what life is, that time exists, what anything is, or that anything exists.[/p]\n\n[p]During this state, the person will usually still experience typical hallucinatory content such as [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]scenery[/int-link], imagery, [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entity[/int-link] contact, etc. However, the hallucinations may become even further defined in terms of their visual clarity and overall complexity. Alongside this, the content of these hallucinations may be significantly more likely to adopt themes that are commonly interpreted as being \"otherworldly\", \"alien\", \"transcendent\", or from a \"higher plane of existence\".  On the contrary, many people also report that at this level their hallucinations do not become better defined, but instead break down and become increasingly fast-moving, formless, rapidly shapeshifting, and incoherent.[/p]\n\n[p]In regards to the person's cognition and general state of mind at this level, there is a much higher likelihood of intense [int-link to=\"/categories/transpersonal-effects\"]transpersonal states[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/spirituality-enhancement\"]spirituality enhancement[/int-link]. These commonly include experiences such as feelings of inextricable [int-link to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"]unity between oneself and the rest of existence[/int-link], metaphysical insights into the supposed nature of reality, and feelings of deep spiritual reverence towards the universe as a whole.[/p]\n\n[p]A heavy DMT experience is the level at which the practical upper limit of what the substance is capable of producing is reached. At this level, the user will be rendered incapable of functioning and communicating in a manner which will leave them completely disconnected from both their environment and their sense of self.[/p] \n\n[p]In terms of its stages, a heavy DMT trip will usually result in all four stages of the experience.

labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]An extreme DMT experience is the level at which the effects have become so powerful and pronounced that the person will typically be rendered unconscious and [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesic[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]At this level, the person will experience the effects typically associated with the previously described heavy dosage during the brief few seconds of the onset and for up to several minutes during the offset of their trip. Throughout the peak they will simply undergo an [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link], black out, and become unconscious for a prolonged period of time that can range anywhere from 10 minutes to half an hour.[/p]\n\n[p]Although extreme psychedelic states may be attractive to certain individuals, it's important to consider that this level of intensity is both less therapeutic and explorative than the previous levels. However, it is also worth noting that when compared to extreme doses of other psychedelics, DMT is considerably less dangerous at this dosage range due to its extremely short duration and comparative lack of [int-link to=\"/categories/uncomfortable-physical-effects\"]intense physical side effects[/int-link].[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Personal commentary[/h2]\n\n[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"]\n[p]It would not remotely be an understatement to say that DMT is by far one of the most important and intriguing psychoactive substances in existence. The profound ease through which it can reliably transport the majority of people into incomprehensibly complex hallucinatory states is perhaps completely unmatched within the world of hallucinogenic compounds. However, it is because of these capabilities that this substance has developed a reputation which is surrounded by misconceptions and cultural mysticism that I feel the need to address within this section directly.[/p]\n\n[p]For example, the claims that DMT is released by the pineal gland during birth, death, and dreaming are entirely unfounded by the scientific literature. This idea was first popularised by the Richard Strassman's book \"The spirit molecule\" in which it was stated as pure speculation more so than as an evidence-backed theory. Although it is true that DMT is found in trace amounts within a vast number of plants and animals (including humans), there is absolutely no evidence that it is specifically produced by the pineal gland or that it is released in psychedelic amounts during certain situations. In fact, the current scientific consensus regarding the prevalence of DMT within plants and animals seems to suggest that it is most likely a byproduct of biological processes that are entirely unrelated to that of the pineal gland.[/p]\n\n[p]In regards to the specific claim that the neurological mechanism responsible for dream states is due to the pineal gland releasing DMT during REM sleep, I think it is worth mentioning my position that the people who believe this have it completely backwards. In my opinion, it's not that normal sleeping dream states occur because endogenous DMT is being released, but that waking dream states are temporarily induced when dosages of DMT and other psychedelics are ingested which are strong enough to cause the specific subjective effect known as internal hallucinations.[/p]\n\n[p]My reasoning behind this is that there are some interesting commonalities between the behaviour of psychedelic induced hallucinations and dreaming that are too prevalent to discount as purely coincidental. For example, the four-tier levelling systems which I have devised for both internal hallucinations and autonomous entity contact communication can both be applied perfectly to dreams and dream character communication in a manner which does not require any substantial changes to their descriptions. Alongside of this, the amnesia that is commonly experienced during the offset of a DMT experience behaves identically to that of the amnesia which is frequently experienced after waking up from a dream. Last of all and in a more subjective sense, the general feeling of a DMT hallucination feels very dreamlike to me and is commonly described as such by many people.[/p]\n\n[p]While there are some apparent aesthetic and behavioural differences between that of psychedelic internal hallucinations and normal dream states, in my opinion, these can be accounted for by the simultaneous occurrence of other subjective effects alongside these high-level internal hallucinations. For example, the simultaneous experience of psychedelic geometry during a hallucinatory state seems to result in it appearing to be physically comprised of ever-shifting and incomprehensibly complex condensed geometric forms in a manner which gives them their well known \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. In terms of their behaviour, however, the simultaneous experience of an incredibly wide range of cognitive states such as ego death and various transpersonal effects seem to synergise and interplay with the specific effect of internal hallucinations in a manner which results in them displaying themes and concepts which would not ordinarily occur during normal dream states.[/p]\n\n[p]Another even more outlandish although less common claim is that DMT literally transports the user's consciousness to an alternate dimension or higher plane of transcendental existence in which the autonomous entities are it's real and living inhabitants. While this idea has likely been around for as long as DMT has been used by human beings, it was seemingly popularised by Terence Mckenna and his recounts of visiting \"machine elves\" within what he claimed was a real space which legitimately existed somewhere outside of the human subconscious. From his perspective, McKenna hypothesised that the DMT was potentially an access point to a parallel universe, a tool through which extraterrestrials use to communicate with us, a space in which human beings from the future reside, or an afterlife which contains an \"ecology of souls\" of previously living and unborn ancestral spirits.[/p]\n\n[p]On some level, I can definitely empathise with these perspectives as it is easy for me to see how a person could come to these conclusions given how absolutely incomprehensible and profound many DMT experiences can be. However, it is still worth noting that for a variety of different reasons, these conclusions almost definitely arise as a result of undergoing the DMT experience without a general understanding of occums razor, critical thinking, and scepticism.  While these various forms of misinformation may seem relatively harmless, I would argue that spreading them as fact is harmful to our community as it gives people the impression that psychedelic users are irrational proponents of pseudoscientific ideas.[/p][/quote]\n\n[hr /]\n[h2]See Also[/h2]\n[ul]\n[li][int-link to=\"/effects\"]Subjective Effect Index[/int-link][/li]\n[li][int-link to=\"/articles/psychedelic-intensity-scale\"]Psychedelic Intensity Scale[/int-link][/li]\n[li][int-link to=\"/articles/dissociative-intensity-scale\"]Dissociative Intensity Scale[/int-link][/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[h3]External links[/h3]\n[ul]\n[li][ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulgin_Rating_Scale\"]Shulgin Rating Scale (Wikipedia)[/ext-link][/li]\n[/ul]",[4868,4873,28,4882,28,4904,28,4920,28,4928,28,4930,48,4934,28,4985,28,4989,28,4993,28,4997,28,5069,28,5105,28,5197,28,5262,48,5264,48,5268,28,5276,28,5280,28,5306,28,5477,28,5480,28,5551,28,5791,28,5793,28,5914,28,6302,28,6304,28,6411,28,6861,28,6863,28,6930,28,7446,28,7448,28,7478,28,7480,28,7484,28,7517,48,7519,48,7522,28,7543,48,7546],{"name":105,"properties":4869,"children":42},{"src":4870,"width":4871,"caption":4872,"align":108,"top":109,"border":109},"/img/gallery/DMT.png","350","N,N-Dimethyltryptamine molecule diagram.",{"name":11,"properties":4874,"children":4875},{},[4876,4877,343],"This article is part of an ongoing effort to document the phenomenological effects of select psychoactive substances by applying comprehensive and formalized definitions from the ",{"name":22,"properties":4878,"children":4880},{"to":4879},"/effects/",[4881],"subjective effect index",{"name":11,"properties":4883,"children":4884},{},[4885,4886,4891,4892,4897,4898,4903],"This is initially being achieved by the ",{"name":22,"properties":4887,"children":4889},{"to":4888},"/profiles/Josie",[4890],"sites founder"," employing her first-hand knowledge of the subjective effects induced by hallucinogenic substances.

The profound ease through which it can reliably transport the majority of people into incomprehensibly complex hallucinatory states is perhaps completely unmatched within the world of hallucinogenic compounds. However, it is because of these capabilities that this substance has developed a reputation which is surrounded by misconceptions and cultural mysticism that I feel the need to address within this section directly.",{"name":11,"properties":7494,"children":7495},{},[7496],"For example, the claims that DMT is released by the pineal gland during birth, death, and dreaming are entirely unfounded by the scientific literature. This idea was first popularised by the Richard Strassman's book \"The spirit molecule\" in which it was stated as pure speculation more so than as an evidence-backed theory. Although it is true that DMT is found in trace amounts within a vast number of plants and animals (including humans), there is absolutely no evidence that it is specifically produced by the pineal gland or that it is released in psychedelic amounts during certain situations. In fact, the current scientific consensus regarding the prevalence of DMT within plants and animals seems to suggest that it is most likely a byproduct of biological processes that are entirely unrelated to that of the pineal gland.",{"name":11,"properties":7498,"children":7499},{},[7500],"In regards to the specific claim that the neurological mechanism responsible for dream states is due to the pineal gland releasing DMT during REM sleep, I think it is worth mentioning my position that the people who believe this have it completely backwards. In my opinion, it's not that normal sleeping dream states occur because endogenous DMT is being released, but that waking dream states are temporarily induced when dosages of DMT and other psychedelics are ingested which are strong enough to cause the specific subjective effect known as internal hallucinations.",{"name":11,"properties":7502,"children":7503},{},[7504],"My reasoning behind this is that there are some interesting commonalities between the behaviour of psychedelic induced hallucinations and dreaming that are too prevalent to discount as purely coincidental. For example, the four-tier levelling systems which I have devised for both internal hallucinations and autonomous entity contact communication can both be applied perfectly to dreams and dream character communication in a manner which does not require any substantial changes to their descriptions. Alongside of this, the amnesia that is commonly experienced during the offset of a DMT experience behaves identically to that of the amnesia which is frequently experienced after waking up from a dream. Last of all and in a more subjective sense, the general feeling of a DMT hallucination feels very dreamlike to me and is commonly described as such by many people.",{"name":11,"properties":7506,"children":7507},{},[7508],"While there are some apparent aesthetic and behavioural differences between that of psychedelic internal hallucinations and normal dream states, in my opinion, these can be accounted for by the simultaneous occurrence of other subjective effects alongside these high-level internal hallucinations. For example, the simultaneous experience of psychedelic geometry during a hallucinatory state seems to result in it appearing to be physically comprised of ever-shifting and incomprehensibly complex condensed geometric forms in a manner which gives them their well known \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. In terms of their behaviour, however, the simultaneous experience of an incredibly wide range of cognitive states such as ego death and various transpersonal effects seem to synergise and interplay with the specific effect of internal hallucinations in a manner which results in them displaying themes and concepts which would not ordinarily occur during normal dream states.",{"name":11,"properties":7510,"children":7511},{},[7512],"Another even more outlandish although less common claim is that DMT literally transports the user's consciousness to an alternate dimension or higher plane of transcendental existence in which the autonomous entities are it's real and living inhabitants. While this idea has likely been around for as long as DMT has been used by human beings, it was seemingly popularised by Terence Mckenna and his recounts of visiting \"machine elves\" within what he claimed was a real space which legitimately existed somewhere outside of the human subconscious. From his perspective, McKenna hypothesised that the DMT was potentially an access point to a parallel universe, a tool through which extraterrestrials use to communicate with us, a space in which human beings from the future reside, or an afterlife which contains an \"ecology of souls\" of previously living and unborn ancestral spirits.",{"name":11,"properties":7514,"children":7515},{},[7516],"On some level, I can definitely empathise with these perspectives as it is easy for me to see how a person could come to these conclusions given how absolutely incomprehensible and profound many DMT experiences can be. However, it is still worth noting that for a variety of different reasons, these conclusions almost definitely arise as a result of undergoing the DMT experience without a general understanding of occums razor, critical thinking, and scepticism.
