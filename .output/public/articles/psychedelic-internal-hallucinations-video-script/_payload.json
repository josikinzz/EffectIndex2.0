In this video I'm going to document and describe the psychedelic manifestation of the specific subjective effect which is known as an Internal Hallucination.[/p]\n\n[p]This will be in accordance with the terminology laid out within our comprehensive Subjective Effect Index and will be done without resorting to metaphors, analogies, or personal trip reports. To give you a better sense of the experience, to the best of our abilities we've also accompanied each description with relevant image and video replications.[/p]\n\n[p]As for the effect itself, an internal hallucination is defined as the perception of a visual hallucination that primarily occurs within an imagined inner environment that is on the back of the users eyelids, in a manner that is similar to that of dreams. In terms of appearance, these hallucinations are also commonly comprised from and embedded within condensed psychedelic geometry, which gives them an incredibly complex, incomprehensible, and otherworldly aesthetic that is clearly demonstrated within the countless examples of visionary artwork shown here within this video.[/p]\n\n[p]To varying degrees, this effect is an extremely common experience at sufficiently heavy dosages of almost any psychedelic compound, with substances such as [i]DMT, ayahuasca, psilocybin, mescaline, and 2C-E[/i] being just some of the more reliable substances for inducing this particlar effect. However, the amount of hallucinatory content experienced during high level psychedelic states tends to vary from person to person, with many people also finding that certain substances are more hallucinatory for them than others.[/p]\n\n[p]It's also worth noting that the internal nature of these hallcunations occur in stark phenomonological contrast to the related subjective effect known as an [i]external hallucination[/i], which can display itself seamlessly into the persons surrounding environment as if it were physically present. I think this is an important distinction to make, because while much less complex hallucinatory effects such as [i]increased pareidolia[/i]... and [i]transformations[/i] do frequently happen during psychedelic experiences, fully formed external hallucinations are quite uncommon and thus usually more associated with deliriant hallucinogens, rather than traditional psychedelics. It's because of this that I am focusing the content on this particular video purely on [i]internal[/i] rather than [i]external[/i] hallucinations, which will have to be directly covered within a future video.[/p]\n\n[p]So at [i]lower levels[/i], internal hallucinations begin with imagery on the back of a person's eyelids, which do not take up the entirety of one's visual field and are generally distinct from their background. This imagery is manifested in varying levels of realism, ranging from ill-defined and cartoon-like to wholly realistic. Once present, they rarely hold their form for more than a few seconds before fading or shifting into another image. This level of intensity also feels incredibly reminiscent to that of hypnagogia, the hallucinatory dream state that many people experience as they are in the process of drifting off to sleep while still remaining partially awake.[/p]\n\n[p]At [i]higher levels[/i], internal hallucinations become increasingly elaborate as they eventually become all-encompassing, fully-fledged 3D scenes that surround the person in a manner similar to that of an extremely vivid [int-link to=\"/effects/dreams\"]dream[/int-link]. This can create the feeling that one has \"broken-through\" into another reality. The things that occur within this perceived alternate reality can be anything, but fall under common archetypes and specific subcomponents such as contact with [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link], incredibly elaborate but often nonsenscial scenarios and plots, within a wide variety of [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]imagined settings, sceneries, and landscapes[/int-link]. Each of which can be classified as distinct subjective effects of their own, with extensive documentation within the subjective effect index that will have to be more fully covered within a number of future videos.[/p]\n\n[p]As for a more precise analysis of the varying degrees of complexity and vividness of this experience, it seems to be proportional to the dosage of the substance consumed. With heavier dosages of a given psychedelic substance producing more concrete and fully fledged hallucinations and lower dosages merely producing fleeting imagery. So in an attempt to comprehensively document the full spectrum of this experience, I have concluded that internal hallucinations are capable of manifesting themselves across the following 5 distinct levels of increasing intensity.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Enhancement of mental visualization\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, internal hallucinations can be defined as a distinct enhancement of the mental visualisation that a person drifts into while daydreaming or using their imagination. This can be described as a short-term detachment from one’s immediate surroundings; during which, a person’s contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by an ill-defined fantasy that is not directly seen in the traditional sense, but is instead felt within one's mind eye. The details of this internal visualisation are also chosen in a slightly spontaneous or autonomous nature, but are mostly consciously controlled by the content of one’s current thought stream.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, internal hallucinations consist of partially defined, blurred, and faded imagery within a person’s visual field. This is where the content of these hallucinations usually becomes more spontaneous in nature and out of the person’s conscious control.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the vividness and intensity increases in a fashion that renders the imagery seen within one’s visual field as fully defined and realistic in its appearance.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the vividness, scope, and intensity of the hallucinations become all-encompassing in a way that displays momentary flashes of fully fledged scenes that surround the person in an immersive environment, similar to that of a vague dream. Although all-encompassing, however, they are still often blurred or transparent in appearance, and the person’s physical senses remain partially connected to the real world.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the highest level, the internal hallucinations further increase to become all-encompassing in a manner that displays long-lasting scenes surrounding the person with an explorable and fully immersive environment similar to that of a dream. This occurs in a fashion that is fully detailed and highly vivid in its appearance. Typically, it also occurs alongside relevant [int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-hallucination\"]auditory[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/tactile-hallucination\"]tactile hallucinations[/int-link], as well as the sensation that a person has become completely disconnected from their physical body.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]Outside of this levelling system, the subjective intensity of internal hallucinations are not only dependent on their detail or level of immersion, but also upon the speed and rate at which they successively occur between each other. For example, during this experience, it is possible to find oneself in a state that presents a relentless stream of intensely vivid hallucinations. This occurs at such a rapid rate that it eventually becomes psychologically exhausting to endure them, regardless of their thematic content. The sheer amount of content experienced in this state often results in powerful [int-link to=\"/effects/time-distortion?s=Time-dilation\"]time dilation[/int-link], which seems to stem from the fact that abnormally large amounts of experiences are being felt in very short periods of time. This is also consistently accompanied by states of sensory overload and [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link] in a manner that can subjectively feel as if it is a consequence of the brain allocating all of its processing power into rendering hallucinations at the expense of other cognitive faculties.[/p]\n\n[p]Regardless of intensity, the content, style, and general behaviour of an internal hallucination is seemingly often dependent on the emotional state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person who is emotionally stable and generally happy will usually be more prone to experiencing neutral, interesting, beautiful, or positive hallucinations. In contrast, however, a person who is emotionally unstable and generally unhappy will usually be more prone to experiencing sinister, fear-inducing, and negative hallucinations.[/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Style Variations[/h2]\n\n[p]Depending on the person and the specific substance consumed, psychedelic hallucinations can manifest in an incredibly wide variety of aesthetic styles that are often subjectively interpreted quite differently between people. For example, many people report that hallucinations under the influence of 2C-E are cartoonish and digital in their presentation, but in contrast however, many people report that equivalent states under the influence of psilocybin are much more likely to be realistic and organic in their general aesthetic styles.[/p]\n\n[p]Alongside of variations in aesthetic style, many psychedelic users also seem to report substantial differences in the thematic content of their hallucinations between both specific substances and the people which use them. This is in a manner which seems to play off of both a given individuals personal interests, the subjective effect profile of a given substance, and the cultural associations that a person may or may not have with that same substance.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of less subjective potential stylistic differences, the patterns experienced during this state can be broken down into a wide range of approximate stylistic variations which include but are certainly not limited to the following examples:[/p]\n\n[separated-textbox a=\"Lucid\" b=\"Delirious\"]A person experiencing a lucid hallucinatory state can maintain a consistent level of awareness regarding the fact that none of these events are actually occurring and the effects are simply the result of a drug-induced hallucination. In contrast, however, delirious hallucinations may become completely believable in a reflexive manner that occurs no matter how nonsensical they may be. [/separated-textbox]\n[separated-textbox a=\"Fixed\" b=\"Interactive\"]Internal hallucinations can present themselves as fixed in their content in a manner that is similar to watching a video play out in front of one’s field of vision. In contrast, they may also be interactive, allowing one to do things such as converse with entities or interact with imagined objects, similarly to that of a dream or virtual reality video game.[/separated-textbox]\n[separated-textbox a=\"New experiences\" b=\"Old experiences\"]In terms of their subject matter, hallucinations can either be entirely new experiences or they can be old, everyday experiences in the form of [int-link to=\"/effects/effects/memory-replays\"]replayed memories[/int-link].[/separated-textbox]\n[separated-textbox a=\"Controllable\" b=\"Autonomous\"]The content of hallucinations can be partially to completely controllable, or they can be seemingly entirely random in nature. For example, when controllable, their content seems to perfectly follow and fit the general subject matter of one’s current thought stream, with varying levels of configurability. In contrast, autonomous hallucinations are presented as completely spontaneous in their subject matter and entirely uncontrollable.[/separated-textbox]\n[separated-textbox a=\"Geometry-based\" b=\"Solid\"]Hallucinations can be comprised of condensed [int-link to=\"/effects/effects/effects/geometry\"]psychedelic geometry[/int-link] or they can appear to be made from realistic and/or lifelike materials. This is usually dependent upon the type of substance consumed, with the former being more common than the latter when under the influence of psychedelic compounds.[/separated-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Personal commentary[/h2]\n\n[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"][p]Now to wrap this video up, I'd just like to make few points. So based upon my own personal exploartion over the years, i can safely say that psychedelic hallucinations can offer a near infinite wealth of experiences and show people things so unfathomably detailed, intricate, and vivid that they are often incomprehensible beyond anything that would ever occur within daily sober living. This understandably leads many people into the belief that some if not all psychedelic hallucinations, are not simply fabrications of the mind but are instead glimpses into an external reality that exists independently of human consicousness.[/p]\n\n[p]However, after a lot of contemplation and experiences with both hallucinatory states and lucid dreaming, I now strongly suspect that internal hallucinations are quite likely to be the drug induced equivalent of the various scenes that most people commonly encounter within their [int-link to=\"/effects/dreams/\"]dreams[/int-link]. This is because there are a number of interesting commonalities between dreams and hallucinations that are too substantial for me to ignore. For example, I think it is interesting that when leaving a sudden onset hallucination induced by a substance such as DMT, there is often a feeling of amnesia that's identical to the feeling of waking up from a dream. Alongside of this, there is often an identical sense of plot acceptance within both dreams and hallucinations that results in the person immediately accepting their current situation as a real life event.[/p]\n\n[p]From personal experience, I can also confirm that the well established \"reality checks\" that can be used within Lucid Dreams to determine whether or not one is currently awake or asleep, do in fact work just as well within high-level drug induced hallucinations. For example, within a dream, subtle details such as written text and clock faces are seemingly incapable of rendering in a static manner. So if a person looks at one of these things, takes note of them, looks away, and then looks back, they will find without fail that the content suddenly changes its appearance each and every single time. This is also true for internal hallucinations in exactly the same manner, and remains true for all of the other standard lucid dreaming reality checks.[/p]\n\n[p]On a less important note, I think it's interesting to consider that the leveling system listed above can not only be applied to internal hallucinations, but can also be applied to the experience of hypnagogia and fully fledged dreams without any significant modifications to its wording. Alongside of this, the levelling system that I devised to measure the coherency of an autonomous entities communication methods can also be perfectly applied to that of dream characters without any modification at all. This was completely unintentional for both of these leveling systems but is, in my personal opinion atleast, not a coincidence.[/p]\n\n[p]So although it could be argued that internal hallucinations are too characteristically different from that of dreams to possibly stem from the similar neurological processes, I think that these differences in their presentation are largely the result of the many other effects that are often simultaneously occurring during these experiences. The most notable one being geometry, which can cause the hallucination to be comprised of the otherworldly shapes and patterns that provide psychedelic hallucinations in particular with their distinctly \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. Alongside of this, various other subjective effects such as synaesthesia, machinescapes, recursion, time distortion, and transpersonal states can all potentially further synergize with the experience.[/p]\n\n[p]However, I am fully aware that this position is merely one of pure speculation and that I cannot prove this definitively. As the years go by, I am therefore hoping that further scientific research and study into this topic will be able to help elucidate the precise neurological mechanisms behind this fascinating experience.[/p][/quote]\n\n[hr/]\nif you've made it this far into the video, thanks so much for watching! \n\n[p]i just want to thank all of the replicators and artists that helped create the content used here. if you liked what you saw please go check out everyone's social media handles within the links in the description below. you'd probably also enjoy our website at effectindex.com and our subreddit at r/replications.[/p]\n\n[p]Also, while i'm here, if you're looking to join our community and contribute to the field of formalized subjective effect documentation, we do actually have a semi-private but very active discord server and we're always looking for more replicators artists creative types programmers developers academics etc. so if that's something you're interested in feel free to send me a friend request on discord at the username josikinz#1066 and if you're a good fit then i would love to invite you in.[/p]\n\n[p]i'm definitely trying to turn this content into an ongoing series and i fully intend to keep churning out more content like this to the best of my abilities. i pretty much have an endless amount of self-created and pre-written content that i'm really excited to export into various youtube videos, so if you like this sort of stuff then please consider checking out my patreon but if not then no worries either way thanks again for watching and have a lovely day[/p]","[\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"captioned-image\",\"properties\":{\"src\":\"/img/gallery/death-by-astonishment-by-salviadroid.jpg\",\"border\":\"true\",\"width\":\"300\",\"artist\":\"SalviaDroid\",\"title\":\"Death by Astonishment\",\"caption\":\"This image serves as an example of visionary art that attempts to accurately portray and replicate the experience of psychedelic level 7 geometry combined with level 5 internal hallucinations.\",\"align\":\"right\",\"top\":\"true\"},\"children\":null},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Hey there!

The most notable one being geometry, which can cause the hallucination to be comprised of the otherworldly shapes and patterns that provide psychedelic hallucinations in particular with their distinctly \\\"hyperspatial\\\" aesthetic. Alongside of this, various other subjective effects such as synaesthesia, machinescapes, recursion, time distortion, and transpersonal states can all potentially further synergize with the experience.\"]},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"However, I am fully aware that this position is merely one of pure speculation and that I cannot prove this definitively.
