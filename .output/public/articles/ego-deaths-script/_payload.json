In this video I'm going to describe and discuss the effects of Ego Death from the Subjective Effect Index. This is an incredibly profound and transformative experience that most commonly occurs under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link], dysdelic, and deliriant compounds.[/p] \n\n[p]The concept of \"ego death\" has developed along a number of related schools of thought that are as varied as, romantic movements, theosophy, anthropological research on rites de passage and shamanism, Joseph Campbell's comparative mythology, Jungian psychology, and transpersonal psychology. However, within this video I am going to be focusing solely on the modern conception of egodeath as recognised within the psychedelic and psychonautic subculture.[/p]\n\n[p]Within the subjective effect index, I’ve put a lot of effort into formalizing terminology for discussing these kinds of effects without resorting to metaphors or analogies that are common in personal trip reports, so let's get right into it. [b]Ego death[/b] (also known as [b]ego suppression[/b], [b]ego loss[/b] or [b]ego dissolution[/b]) is the temporary experience of a partial or complete disruption of a person's sense of self, which often results in a range of profound changes to how the person perceives and interprets their own sense of identity and the nature of agency and self-hood.[ref to=\"1\" /][ref to=\"2\" /][ref to=\"3\" /][ref to=\"4\" /][ref to=\"5\" /][/p]\n\n[toc/]\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"ego-death-subcategories\"]Ego Death Subcategories[/h2]\n[p]Within the psychedelic community, the term ego death colloquially applies to a number of somewhat similar experiences which I have divided into the following 3 subcategories.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"type-1\" label=\"Type 1\" header=\"Absent selfhood\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]An [i]absent selfhood[/i] can be described as a complete lack of the subjective experience of one's own sense of identity. During this form of ego death, there is a profound experience of no longer having an “I” experiencing one's sensory input; there is just awareness of sensory input as it is and by itself without a conscious agent to comment on or think about what is happening to it.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"type-2\" label=\"Type 2\" header=\"Objectified selfhood\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]An [i]objectified selfhood[/i] can be described as a person remaining aware of the existence of their self, but they no longer feel integrally attached to their identity. Instead of feeling that they are a unified whole with their sense of self, their awareness feels entirely separate from it's own identity, as if this selfhood is now the object of experience instead of the subject.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"type-3\" label=\"Type 3\" header=\"Expanded selfhood\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]An [i]expanded selfhood[/i] can be described as one's sense of identity becoming coming to include a wider array of concepts than it previously did. For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively constituted by their ego and physical body, this effect can cause their sense of identity to also include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. This results in intense and inextricable feelings of unity or interconnectedness between the self and varying arrays of previously \"external\" systems.[/p]\n\n[p]For more information on this particular experience, please see my recent extremely detailed 20 minute video on states of [int-link to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"]Unity and Interconnectedness[/int-link].[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"fear of losing control\"]Fear of losing control[/h2]\n\n[p][i]Fear of losing control[/i] is a very common occurrence when a person who undergoes ego death is not emotionally prepared, not in an appropriate set or setting, or is simply unwilling to relinquish their sense of selfhood. During this experience, the person will often find themselves experiencing overwhelming fear and anxiety relating to the fear of losing control. This fear and anxiety is especially common in those who have not experienced ego death before. [/p]\n\n[p]To overcome this fear, it is recommended that the person does their best to stop fighting the loss of control, and simply surrender themselves to the experience of ego death. Upon successfully relaxing into ego death, the person will often experience a radical and positive change in their emotional state.[/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"transformative-aspects\"]Transformative aspects[/h2]\n\n[p]Ego death is well known for the transformative and significant impacts it can have on a person's perception of both themselves and the world around them.

The characteristics of rejuvenation often include a sustained sense of heightened mental clarity, personal bias suppression, and increased emotional stability, calmness, mindfulness, motivation, wellbeing, and focus. At its highest level, feelings of rejuvenation can become so intense that they manifest as the profound and overwhelming sensation of being \"reborn.\" Within the context of ego death, rejuvenation often feels as if it has occurred in a manner akin to rebooting a computer.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"personal-bias-suppression\" header=\"Personal Bias Suppression\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p][i][int-link to=\"/effects/personal-bias-suppression\"]Personal bias suppression[/int-link][/i] is a decrease in the personal or cultural biases, preferences, and associations a person knowingly or unknowingly uses to filter and interpret their perception of the world.

Those who have undergone ego death often report that they not only \"[i]experienced what it is like to die[/i]\", but also became both accustomed to and substantially less afraid of the prospect. Letting go during ego death and willfully surrendering one's own sense of self is often likened to preconceived notions about what it is like to die, which may cause this effect.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"viewing-the-self-as-an-illusory-construct\" header=\"Viewing the self as an illusory construct\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]Viewing the self as an illusory construct[/i] commonly results from the way undergoing the ego-death experience provokes a radical reframing of the nature of the self. This new perspective may take a number of forms. For example, in the case of [i]absent[/i] and [i]objectified self-hood[/i], one may conclude that the ego is not an essential component of who they are, but is instead a construct of the mind, conditioned by one's history and particular circumstances. [/p]\n\n[p]In the case of [i]expanded self-hood,[/i] where the experienced boundary between oneself and the external world is absent, it is common to become convinced that no such boundary ever actually existed. One may then believe that they are identical in nature to the universe as a unified whole, experiencing itself and expressing itself through a particular mind and body.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"increased-openness-to-experience\" header=\"Increased openness to experience\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]Increased openness to experience[/i] is a  shift in personality that is commonly reported after the experience of ego death. This change may occur as a result of feeling less obliged to conform to a particular identity and thus becoming more likely to engage in novel experiences.[/p]\n\n[p]Alternatively, those who have undergone [i]personal bias suppression[/i] will also often find themselves more open to experiences that they may have previously disregarded because they are able to reassess their interest with a fresh perspective.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"subjective-differences-between-various-substances\"] Subjective differences between various substances [/h2]\n\n[p]Within the context of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] use, ego death is most commonly triggered at heavy doses by states of high level [int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression\"]memory suppression[/int-link] which causes the person to forget who they are. At other times it can be triggered by or in combination with [int-link to=\"/effects/sensory-overload\"]sensory overload[/int-link] consuming the person's consciousness with information and overwhelming their sense of self.[/p]\n\n[p]Within the context of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] use, ego death seems to be triggered at heavy doses by increasingly intense [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-disconnection\"]cognitive disconnection[/int-link] causing a person to become dissociated from cognitive functions such as the maintenance of a sense of identity.[/p]\n\n[p]Psychedelic ego death usually occurs alongside states of level 6-7 [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] of an intense and often overwhelming nature. It may synergize with other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/personal-bias-suppression\"]personal bias suppression[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"]unity and interconnectedness[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/spirituality-enhancement\"]spirituality enhancement[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link]. These accompanying effects further elevate the subjective intensity and transpersonal significance of ego death experiences.[/p]\n\n[p]Dissociative ego death usually occurs alongside high level [int-link to=\"/categories/disconnective-effects\"]sensory disconnection[/int-link] and out of body experiences which may take place within [int-link to=\"/categories//effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]voids or holes[/int-link] filled with [int-link to=\"/categories//effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures\"]hallucinatory structures[/int-link]. Dissociative ego death is less likely to cause an anxious response for those who are inexperienced compared to psychedelic ego death. This is because many people experience dissociatives as inherently calming and tranquil while high doses of psychedelics are quite often experienced as the opposite.[/p]\n\n[p]Outside of psychedelics and dissociatives, it is also possible to experience ego death under the influence of a few other classes of psychoactive compounds. For example, extremely heavy doses of [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants\"]deliriants[/int-link] such as DPH or datura can result in ego death that is accompanied by [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/psychosis\"]psychosis[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link]. Heavy doses of salvia divinorum are extremely effective at inducing ego death that is accompanied by bizarre [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entity contact[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/machinescapes\"]machinescapes[/int-link]. Although these two classes of hallucinogens function very differently on both a subjective and neuropharmacological level, both of their variations on ego death feel as if they stem from a break down or deterioration in the brain's ability to maintain normal levels of cognitive functioning.[/p]\n[hr/]\n[h3 id=\"similar concepts\"]Original usage and Academic Definitions[/h3]\n[p]Throughout history there have been similar concepts that were not specifically called 'ego death,' but can be seen as antecedents. These include, but are not limited to, a wide array of religious and philosophical concepts such as Anatta[ref to=\"6\" /], Satori[ref to=\"7\" /], and Jhana[ref to=\"8\" /] in Vedanta and Zen Buddhism, and Fana in Sufi Islam[ref to=\"9\" /].[/p]\n\n[p]Now as for the first identified literary use of the term 'ego death' or 'ego loss' that is in line with the contemporary concept, this seems to be contained within the 1964 book titled '[i]The Psychedelic Experience - A manual based on the tibetan book of the dead[/i]' by Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner, & Richard Alpert[ref to=\"11\" /]. In it, Leary describes ego death as a product of the \"[i]complete transcendence − beyond words, beyond space−time, beyond self[/i]\" experienced during the peak of the psychedelic experience. [/p]\n\n[p]There are too many specific examples for me to possibly list within this video, but since the publication of this book, ego death has been defined by academics and scholars within the broader literature in a variety of similar ways.[/p]\n\n[ul]\n\n[li] For instance, In 1964 Randolf Alnaes published \"Therapeutic applications of the change in consciousness produced by psycholytica\" in which he defines ego death as a \"Loss of ego-feeling.\"[ref to=\"12\" /] [/li]\n\n[li] In 1988, Stanislav Grof defined ego death as \"a sense of total annihilation... This experience of \"ego death\" seems to entail an instant merciless destruction of all previous reference points in the life of the individual... Ego death means an irreversible end to one's philosophical identification with what Alan Watts called \"skin-encapsulated ego.\"[ref to=\"13\" /] [/li]\n\n[li] In 2001 Carter Phipps defined ego death as \"the renunciation, rejection and, ultimately, the death of the need to hold on to a separate, self-centered existence.\" [ref to=\"14\" /] [/li]\n\n[li] In 2007 religious studies scholar Daniel Merkur defined ego death as \"an imageless experience in which there is no sense of personal identity. It is the experience that remains possible in a state of extremely deep trance when the ego-functions of reality-testing, sense-perception, memory, reason, fantasy and self-representation are repressed.\"[ref to=\"15\" /] [/li]\n\n[li] In 2008, Johnson, Richards & Griffiths paraphrased Leary and Grof by defining ego death as \"temporarily experiencing a complete loss of subjective self-identity.\"[ref to=\"16\" /] [/li]\n\n[li] In 2010, the psychologist John Harrison defined ego death as a \"Temporary ego death as the loss of the separate self, or, in the affirmative, a deep and profound merging with the transcendent other.\" [ref to=\"17\" /] [/li]\n\n[li]In 2016, The Ego-Dissolution Inventory was developed as a validated self-report questionnaire that allows for the measurement of ego death experiences. It defines ego dissolution as \"The experience of a compromised sense of self\".[ref to=\"18\" /] [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[h3 id=\"Neuroscientific speculation\"]Neuroscientific speculation[/h3]\n[p]In terms of the precise neurological mechanisms behind this experience, there is an increasing amount of speculation within psychedelic communities which posits that the triggering of ego death is tied into the way psychedelic substances disrupt the Default Mode Network (DMN)[ref to=\"19\" /], the large-scale brain network best known for being active when a person is awake but not focused on the outside world, such as during daydreaming and mind-wandering.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of scientific evidence for this theory, one study has demonstrated that psilocybin does indeed cause reduced blood flow to the posterior cingulate cortex and pre-frontal cortex, which are two areas of the brain considered to be the main nodes of the DMN.[ref to=\"20\" /] Another study has demonstrated that while LSD does not necessarily reduce activity within the DMN, it does desynchronize the brain regions that constitute it.[ref to=\"21\" /] Despite these findings, however, the exact relationship between disruptions of the DMN and the experience of egodeath have not yet been conclusively demonstrated.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n[p]If you've made it this far into the video, thanks so much for watching![/p]\n\n[p]I've really been enjoying making these videos during my freetime recently and I have an essentially endless amount of ideas for video topics and livestreams coming up in the near future. I guess I just want to take a moment to directly thank all of my new and old my patreon supporters. A lot of you have been supporting me for years now, even when it probably seemed like I had disapeared off of the face of the earth.[/p] \n\n[p]In order to improve the value of pledging to me, I recently added a $5+ tier called \"psychonautics advisee\", which essentially means that I will more than happily do my best to casually offer my informal opinions on and answer any questions you may have regarding psychonautics and the general exploration of altered states of consciousness.
