In this video, I'm going to describe and discuss the subjective effect profile of Dimethyltryptamine or DMT from the perspective of the Subjective Effect Index. This is an incredibly profound and transformative experience that most commonly occurs under the influence of heavy dosages of psychedelic, dissociative, dysdelic, and deliriant compounds.[/p] \n\n[p]DMT is a smokable [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/visual\"]psychedelic hallucinogen[/int-link] within the tryptamine chemical class. It is also found as a naturally occurring endogenous byproduct within a huge variety of plants and animals, [ext-link to=\"https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/dta.422\"]including humans[/ext-link]. The substance itself induces a brief but extremely intense psychedelic experience, alongside a disproportionate amount of hallucinatory content in comparison to other traditional psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, and mescaline.[/p]\n\n[p]This videdo exclusively discusses DMT’s subjective effects. If you would like to learn more about DMT's chemistry, pharmacology, history, legality, and potential dangers, refer to its dedicated article on psychonautwiki.[/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Durational stages[/h2]\n[ul]\n[li][b]Total :[/b] 5 - 20 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Onset :[/b] 20 - 40 seconds[/li]\n[li][b]Come up :[/b] 1 - 3 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Peak :[/b] 2 - 8 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Offset :[/b] 1 - 6 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]After effects :[/b] 10 - 60 minutes[/li]\n[/ul]\n[p]Within around 5-20 minutes, the progression of a DMT trip seems to progress through four separate stages of experience that each feel distinct from one another. At heavy dosages the user may find themselves progressing through all of these stages in sequence, while low-dose experiences may skip over stages 2 or 3. I will define and describe these stages now.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Taking off\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"chart-line.svg\"]\n[p]The first stage of a DMT trip is the onset, which leads into what is commonly referred to as \"breaking through\".[/p]\n\n[p]As the user smokes DMT, effects typically begins with the sudden onset of distinct [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-enhancements\"]visual enhancements[/int-link], which are immediately followed by high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] and a [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]warm tingling sensation across the skin[/int-link]. At higher dosages, the user may find the pipe that they are using to smoke their DMT has transformed into an incomprehensible mass of geometry that is quite difficult to put down or hand off to someone nearby. There may also be [int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-hallucination\"]auditory hallucinations[/int-link] that resemble soft crackling. For example, some users report an extended tone that quickly rises in volume and pitch as the intensity of [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-effects\"]visual effects[/int-link] also increases.[/p]\n\n[p]When it does occur, this sound typically becomes all-enveloping and abruptly ends as one of several different “take off” variations are experienced. Which include, but are not limited to:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li]Increasingly intense [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link], which becomes so all-enveloping that the visible environment is completely blocked out and replaced.[/li]\n[li]Feelings of being suddenly pushed through – and onto – the other side of a membrane.[/li]\n[li]The environment forming into a geometry-filled tunnel, which the user moves into as it widens and subsequently encompasses their entire vision.[/li]\n[li]The environment splitting into separated sections, leaving a gaping chasm filled with high-level geometry as the user separates from their body and is then catapulted directly into it at a high speed.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]This process of \"taking off\" typically occurs within the range of about 30 seconds to a minute, and leads directly onto the second stage of a DMT trip.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 2\" header=\"The Waiting Room\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"hourglass.svg\"]\n[p]Almost immediately after a person has smoked enough DMT to “[i]take off[/i]”, they sometimes find themselves spending approximately 10 - 30 seconds in what is often described as a psychedelic “[i]waiting room[/i]”. It can take on any appearance, but most commonly presents itself as a tunnel, room, or space that is comprised of fast moving [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]In fact, this \"waiting room\" feels distinctively different from the main bulk of the trip to such an extent that it has led many DMT users to speculate that it is potentially some sort of psychedelic loading screen, during which the upcoming trip is being generated and planned out by the subconscious mind.[/p]\n\n[p]After “taking off”, the person will usually transition into the most impressive stage of the experience. However, in certain cases the user may feel stuck within the waiting room, and may even experience hallucinatory [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] suggesting that they are not yet ready to proceed past it. It's also important to note that although still relatively common in its occurrence, the waiting room is the least consistent stage of a DMT trip, and many users will never experience it at all, while simply finding that their DMT trips skip over it instead.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 3\" header=\"The Other Side\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"geometry.svg\"]\n[p]Once the waiting room stage is either finished or skipped over, the user will feel that they have broken through into what is commonly referred to as the \"other side\". It is here where an incredibly wide variety of potential hallucinatory content can manifest itself. However, this intensified stage will still usually follow somewhat consistent themes and archetypes that are reported by many people who experience the substance.[/p]\n\n[p]These themes generally consist of visiting a hallucinated alternate reality that is often said to feel \"more real\" than everyday life. In terms of their visual aesthetic, these hallucinatory spaces usually consist of incomprehensibly complex psychedelic [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] that is condensed into [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]settings or scenes[/int-link]. Examples of DMT spaces include landscapes, fractalscapes, rooms, buildings, cities, tunnels, caverns, non-euclidean structures resembling a hive or nest, womb-like environments, and an infinite variety of potential others.[/p]\n\n[p]Within DMT spaces, there are often one or more [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link] within the user's perceived field of vision. These entities frequently act as if they have been waiting for the user's arrival, and are usually unphased by the person's sudden apparition. Upon noticing the user, DMT entities may enthusiastically greet them, but reactions of surprise, indifference, or ambivalence are also equally common. These entities may also convey a sense of urgency, as though attempting to demonstrate a multitude of incredible things during the short amount of time that they have before the effects of the drug wear off.[/p]\n\n[p]During these experiences, [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]hallucinatory entities[/int-link] may employ a variety of [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity?s=communication-styles\"]communnication styles[/int-link], including: [i]spoken language, direct manipulation of the visual environment, choreographed movement, telepathy, beams of energy or information, visual languages, or any combination of these[/i]. Through means such as these, entities often seemingly attempt to either explain some message to the user, or provide a guided tour of some aspect of the [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link] which they inhabit. The message often feels personalized and related to the user's life or emotional well-being, but can also contain aspects that seem entirely nonsensical or ineffable when removed from the context of the DMT trip.[/p]\n\n[p]These [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] will often dubiously present themselves as all-knowing, and although they can take any visual form, some visual archetypes are more commonly experienced, including: [i]humanoids, aliens, elves, insectoids, giant spheres, beings of light, plants, jesters, maternal or nurturing guardians, and complex robotic machines[/i]. At this point it is common for the user (unless they are very experienced) to be completely overwhelmed by the DMT trip, despite it also often feeling relatively clear-headed. This sometimes results in the entities encouraging the user to stay calm, to not give into astonishment, and to simply try to pay attention to what is happening.[/p]\n\n[p]Although they are common, it is worth noting that these [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entity[/int-link]-filled [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]hallucinatory spaces[/int-link] do not necessarily occur for every person and are not entirely consistent in their manifestation between trips. A certain number of people do not seem to experience hallucinations at all, and instead simply find themselves engulfed in all-encompassing high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] during this stage of the DMT trip. Thus, the frequency with which any given user encounters entity-filled DMT spaces varies.[/p]\n\n[p]After 2 - 10 minutes of this experience, the DMT trip will begin to wear off while moving into its fourth and final stage.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 4\" header=\"Coming Down\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\" icon=\"chart-line-down.svg\"]\n[p]The final stage concludes the trip, with either the sensation of being pulled progressively further away from the [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link], or the hallucinations becoming increasingly vague and ill-defined until imperceptible. During this process, the [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] will sometimes bid farewell and encourage the person to return if given the chance.[/p]\n\n[p]Once over, the user immediately finds themselves back in reality with strong level 4 - 5 visual [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] which quickly fades. Similar to how the content of a dream is commonly forgotten upon waking up, detailed memories of DMT experiences also often rapidly deteriorate upon returning to baseline consciousness. This [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link] can be counteracted by taking notes, recounting the trip to another person in detail, recording a narration of the experience on audio or video, or using other such method.[/p]\n\n[p]As the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] becomes more mild and [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link] sets in, the user will often experience a sense of being [int-link to=\"/effects/physical-euphoria\"]bathed in euphoria and awe[/int-link]. The geometry typically persists for an additional 5 - 10 minutes before disappearing completely, leaving a strong [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]body high[/int-link] that can persist for up to half an hour in extreme cases. This afterglow typically feels like a warm fuzziness throughout the body, and often leaves behind a sense of cognitive [int-link to=\"/effects/rejuvenation\"]rejuvenation[/int-link], well-being, and mental clarity which can last for hours, days, or even weeks after the trip.[/p]\n\n[p]However, it is worth noting that if the user has consumed a dosage that is not strong enough to reach stages two and three, then this experience of coming down will simply manifest as a progressive reduction of intensity without any of the aforementioned effects or details.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n[h2]Intensity Scale[/h2]\n[p]Now that I've covered my model of durational stages, I would like to cover a generalised intensity scale that can be applied to the DMT experience as a whole. This intensity scale breaks the subjective effects of DMT into six distinct levels based around dosage range and subjective intensity, in which each level typically contains an expanding list of effects that generally intensify relative to the dosage consumed.[/p]\n\n[p]Without listing them off verbally, for each level I will also display lists of specific subjective effects organized by their approximate frequency of occurence, which all have their own dedicated articles within the Subjective Effect Index on EffectIndex.com.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Subtle\" subHeader=\"2-10 mg\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]A subtle DMT experience is the level at which it first becomes apparent that the substance is producing effects. This is typically comprised of benign sensory and cognitive effects such as [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-amplifications\"]visual amplifications[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-distortions\"]visual distortions[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/categories/cognitive-effects\"]cognitive alterations[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]Although this experience is more distinct than a placebo, the substances effects may not demand the user’s attention and can be willfully ignored. For example, if the user is distracted, they may not even notice the effects.[/p]\n\n[p]At most, a subtle DMT trip may resemble an incredibly mild version of the \"take off\" stage of the experience, skipping over stages two and three.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[columns]\n[column]\n[panel title=\"Sensory\" icon=\"eye.svg\"]\n[h3][int-link to=\"/articles/approximate-frequency-of-occurrence-scale\"]frequent[/int-link][/h3]\n[ul]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/colour-enhancement\"]Colour enhancement[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/drifting\"]Drifting[/int-link][/b] [sup](level 1-2)[/sup][/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[h3][int-link to=\"/articles/approximate-frequency-of-occurrence-scale\"]common[/int-link][/h3]\n[ul]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/increased-pareidolia\"]Increased pareidolia[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/symmetrical-texture-repetition\"]Symmetrical texture repetition[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/tracers\"]Tracers[/int-link][/b] [sup](level 1-2)[/sup][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/visual-acuity-enhancement\"]Visual acuity enhancement[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[/ul]\n[/panel]\n[/column]\n\n[column]\n[panel title=\"Cognitive\" icon=\"user.svg\"]\n[h3][int-link to=\"/articles/approximate-frequency-of-occurrence-scale\"]frequent[/int-link][/h3]\n[ul]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/conceptual-thinking\"]Conceptual thinking[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/novelty-enhancement\"]Novelty enhancement[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/wakefulness\"]Wakefulness[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[h3][int-link to=\"/articles/approximate-frequency-of-occurrence-scale\"]common[/int-link][/h3]\n[ul]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/analysis-enhancement\"]Analysis enhancement[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/emotion-enhancement\"]Emotion enhancement[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/increased-music-appreciation\"]Increased music appreciation[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[/ul]\n[/panel]\n[/column]\n\n[column]\n[/column]\n[/columns]\n\n[hr opacity=\"0.5\" /]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Mild\" subHeader=\"10-20mg\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]At this level, the effects of DMT typically include a range of faintly perceptible effects such as defined [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-distortions\"]visual distortions[/int-link], subtle or indiscernible [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link], mild [int-link to=\"/categories/cognitive-effects\"]cognitive effects[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]spontaneous tactile sensations[/int-link] such as a warm fuzzy tingling sensation that encompasses the body.[/p]\n\n[p][int-link to=\"/effects/drifting?s=variations\"]The style variations of visual drifting[/int-link] experienced at this intensity generally incorporate [i]intricate complexity, abstract form, fast movement, smooth motion, static permanence, and a realistic style[/i].

These effects include a range of well-defined [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-amplifications\"]visual amplifications[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-distortions\"]visual distortions[/int-link], complex [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link], mild [int-link to=\"/categories/hallucinatory-states\"]hallucinatory states[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/categories/cognitive-effects\"]cognitive effects[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]spontaneous tactile sensations[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]The [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry?s=variations\"]style variations[/int-link] of DMT’s visual geometry generally feature [i]intricate complexity, abstract form, structured organization, bright lighting, a full or expanded color range, glossy shading, varied roundness and angularity, large size, rapid speed, a smooth framerate, immersion, and a consistent intensity[/i]. At higher doses, this geometry is significantly more likely to result in states of [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-exposure-to-inner-mechanics-of-consciousness\"]visual exposure to the inner mechanics of consciousness[/int-link] rather than a [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-exposure-to-semantic-concept-network\"]visual exposure to one's semantic concept network[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]It is also worth noting that the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] induced by vaporized DMT is widely considered to be the most profoundly intricate and complex manifestation of this effect out of any and all psychedelic drugs. Compared to the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry?s=variations\"]style of geometry[/int-link] produced by ayahuasca, the geometry appears more synthetic and digital in material composition, it demonstrates colour schemes that are similar to those experienced on LSD, and has an organized geometric structure reminiscent of that produced by psilocybin.[/p]\n\n[p]At this level, spontaneous tactile sensations become pronounced and fully manifested. The [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations?s=variations\"]style variations of these bodily sensations[/int-link] includes [i]a constant duration, feelings of movement, gentle character, all-encompassing placement, and euphoric in pleasurability[/i]. This sensation typically maintains a consistent presence that quickly rises with the onset and hits a limit once the peak has been reached. It is usually only moderate in its intensity, but is capable of becoming very powerful at higher doses and can sometimes persist for up to half an hour after the experience itself has ended.[/p]\n\n[p]During a distinct DMT experience, the general nature of the substance becomes well-defined enough that ignoring its effects is difficult.

The user typically feels like they have broken through into the hallucinatory [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link], as previously described in the \"[i]other side[/i]\" section of this video.[/p]\n\n[p]For most people, a strong dose of DMT will produce high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] more consistently than any other psychedelic. The style variations of these internal hallucinations is that they are usually [i]lucid in awareness, interactive, novel in subject, autonomous and non-controllable, and psychedelic in appearance[/i]. This is accompanied by other hallucinatory effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]sceneries and landscapes[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]narrative scenarios[/int-link]. These hallucinations can involve an endless variety of themes that may be personal, religious, spiritual, futuristic, magical, surreal, nonsensical, or transcendental in nature.[/p]\n\n[p]It's also worth mentioning that during the onset of this intensity range and above, the user will often experiences [int-link to=\"/effects/changes-in-felt-gravity\"]changes in their perception of gravity[/int-link] which commonly involve feelings of floating at extreme speeds either forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards, or in an unspecifiable direction. This will usually stop once the user has reached their \"destination\" but will often continue at a much slower pace if the hallucination involves moving around within a specific location.[/p]\n\n[p]Despite intense hallucinations at this dosage range, the user will often still feel partially connected to their physical body even while traversing [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]hallucinatory spaces[/int-link]. Most users will also automatically close their eyes and allow themselves to be immersed in the internal experience – however, if the user suddenly opens their eyes midway through the trip, they will likely leave the hallucinatory space. Upon interrupting their [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], the user will typically experience much less-intense [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-effects\"]visual effects[/int-link] with their eyes open. These effects typically include strong [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-distortions\"]visual distortions[/int-link] and highly complex [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] that almost completely cover the user's field of view. Upon closing their eyes again, the user may find themselves placed directly back into the same [int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]hallucinatory scenario[/int-link], or they may simply experience high-level geometry while being unable to completely re-enter their internal hallucination.[/p]\n\n[p]During less intense DMT breakthroughs experienced at this dosage range, many users report feeling surprisingly lucid and clear-headed in comparison to an equally-intense dose of psilocybin, mescaline, or LSD. However, the insightful and therapeutic cognitive effects that are heavily associated with psychedelic experiences are frequently either entirely absent or significantly reduced. This may be a result of DMT's extremely short duration, which does not allow the person much time to deeply contemplate or experience its cognitive effects.[/p]\n\nIf the user is inexperienced with psychedelic substances while undergoing this dosage range or above, they may find themselves experiencing [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety\"]anxiety[/int-link] and fear throughout the duration of the trip. This is not because DMT is inherently anxiety-inducing, but is more likely a response to being thrust into a profoundly complex, bizarre, overwhelming, and unfamiliar situation. As with any hallucinogen, it is always safest to slowly increase an inexperienced person's dosage in small increments over the course of multiple trips, and at a rate which the user is comfortable with. \n\n[p]A strong DMT experience is powerful enough to render the user mostly incapable of functioning normally, social interactions, or thinking in a sober manner. At this level of intensity, the effects of the substance are obvious and cannot be ignored in any capacity, leaving the user completely engaged in the experience whether they wish to be or not.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of its stages, a strong DMT trip will usually result in all four stages of the experience, but with the \"other side\" being distinctly present – although it will still become more defined at higher dosages. The effects that generally occur at this level of intensity are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, listed below.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[columns]\n[column]\n[panel

Alongside this, the content of these hallucinations may be significantly more likely to adopt themes that are commonly interpreted as being \"otherworldly\", \"alien\", \"transcendent\", or from a \"higher plane of existence\".  On the contrary, many people also report that at this level their hallucinations do not become better defined, but instead break down and become increasingly fast-moving, formless, rapidly shapeshifting, and incoherent.[/p]\n\n[p]In regards to the person's cognition and general state of mind at this level, there is a much higher likelihood of intense [int-link to=\"/categories/transpersonal-effects\"]transpersonal states[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/spirituality-enhancement\"]spirituality enhancement[/int-link].

rendered unconscious and [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesic[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]At this level, the person will experience the effects typically associated with the previously described heavy dosage during the brief few seconds of the onset and for up to several minutes during the offset of their trip. Throughout the peak they will simply undergo an [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link], black out, and become unconscious for a prolonged period of time that can range anywhere from 10 minutes to half an hour.[/p]\n\n[p]Although extreme psychedelic states may be attractive to certain individuals, it's important to consider that this level of intensity is both less therapeutic and explorative than the previous levels. However, it is also worth noting that when compared to extreme doses of other psychedelics, DMT is considerably less dangerous at this dosage range due to its extremely short duration and comparative lack of [int-link to=\"/categories/uncomfortable-physical-effects\"]intense physical side effects[/int-link].[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Personal commentary[/h2]\n\n[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"]\n[p]It would not remotely be an understatement to say that DMT is by far one of the most important and intriguing psychoactive substances in existence. The profound ease through which it can reliably transport the majority of people into incomprehensibly complex hallucinatory states is perhaps completely unmatched within the world of hallucinogenic compounds. However, it is because of these capabilities that this substance has developed a reputation which is surrounded by misconceptions and cultural mysticism that I feel the need to address within this section directly.[/p]\n\n[p]For example, the claims that DMT is released by the pineal gland during birth, death, and dreaming are entirely unfounded by the scientific literature. This idea was first popularised by the Richard Strassman's book \"The spirit molecule\" in which it was stated as pure speculation more so than as an evidence-backed theory. Although it is true that DMT is found in trace amounts within a vast number of plants and animals (including humans), there is absolutely no evidence that it is specifically produced by the pineal gland or that it is released in psychedelic amounts during certain situations. In fact, the current scientific consensus regarding the prevalence of DMT within plants and animals seems to suggest that it is most likely a byproduct of biological processes that are entirely unrelated to that of the pineal gland.[/p]\n\n[p]In regards to the specific claim that the neurological mechanism responsible for dream states is due to the pineal gland releasing DMT during REM sleep, I think it is worth mentioning my position that the people who believe this have it completely backwards. In my opinion, it's not that normal sleeping dream states occur because endogenous DMT is being released, but that waking dream states are temporarily induced when dosages of DMT and other psychedelics are ingested which are strong enough to cause the specific subjective effect known as internal hallucinations.[/p]\n\n[p]My reasoning behind this is that there are some interesting commonalities between the behaviour of psychedelic induced hallucinations and dreaming that are too prevalent to discount as purely coincidental. For example, the four-tier levelling systems which I have devised for both internal hallucinations and autonomous entity contact communication can both be applied perfectly to dreams and dream character communication in a manner which does not require any substantial changes to their descriptions. Alongside of this, the amnesia that is commonly experienced during the offset of a DMT experience behaves identically to that of the amnesia which is frequently experienced after waking up from a dream. Last of all and in a more subjective sense, the general feeling of a DMT hallucination feels very dreamlike to me and is commonly described as such by many people.[/p]\n\n[p]While there are some apparent aesthetic and behavioural differences between that of psychedelic internal hallucinations and normal dream states, in my opinion, these can be accounted for by the simultaneous occurrence of other subjective effects alongside these high-level internal hallucinations. For example, the simultaneous experience of psychedelic geometry during a hallucinatory state seems to result in it appearing to be physically comprised of ever-shifting and incomprehensibly complex condensed geometric forms in a manner which gives them their well known \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. In terms of their behaviour, however, the simultaneous experience of an incredibly wide range of cognitive states such as ego death and various transpersonal effects seem to synergise and interplay with the specific effect of internal hallucinations in a manner which results in them displaying themes and concepts which would not ordinarily occur during normal dream states.[/p]\n\n[p]Another even more outlandish although less common claim is that DMT literally transports the user's consciousness to an alternate dimension or higher plane of transcendental existence in which the autonomous entities are it's real and living inhabitants. While this idea has likely been around for as long as DMT has been used by human beings, it was seemingly popularised by Terence Mckenna and his recounts of visiting \"machine elves\" within what he claimed was a real space which legitimately existed somewhere outside of the human subconscious. From his perspective, McKenna hypothesised that the DMT was potentially an access point to a parallel universe, a tool through which extraterrestrials use to communicate with us, a space in which human beings from the future reside, or an afterlife which contains an \"ecology of souls\" of previously living and unborn ancestral spirits.[/p]\n\n[p]On some level, I can definitely empathise with these perspectives as it is easy for me to see how a person could come to these conclusions given how absolutely incomprehensible and profound many DMT experiences can be. However, it is still worth noting that for a variety of different reasons, these conclusions almost definitely arise as a result of undergoing the DMT experience without a general understanding of occums razor, critical thinking, and scepticism.  While these various forms of misinformation may seem relatively harmless, I would argue that spreading them as fact is harmful to our community as it gives people the impression that psychedelic users are irrational proponents of pseudoscientific ideas.[/p][/quote]\n\n[hr /]\n[h2]See Also[/h2]\n[ul]\n[li][int-link to=\"/effects\"]Subjective Effect Index[/int-link][/li]\n[li][int-link to=\"/articles/psychedelic-intensity-scale\"]Psychedelic Intensity Scale[/int-link][/li]\n[li][int-link to=\"/articles/dissociative-intensity-scale\"]Dissociative Intensity Scale[/int-link][/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[h3]External links[/h3]\n[ul]\n[li][ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulgin_Rating_Scale\"]Shulgin Rating Scale (Wikipedia)[/ext-link][/li]\n[/ul]","[{\"name\":\"captioned-image\",\"properties\":{\"src\":\"/img/gallery/DMT.png\",\"width\":\"350\",\"caption\":\"N,N-Dimethyltryptamine molecule diagram.\",\"align\":\"right\",\"top\":\"true\",\"border\":\"true\"},\"children\":null},{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Hey there!

Although it is true that DMT is found in trace amounts within a vast number of plants and animals (including humans), there is absolutely no evidence that it is specifically produced by the pineal gland or that it is released in psychedelic amounts during certain situations.

Alongside of this, the amnesia that is commonly experienced during the offset of a DMT experience behaves identically to that of the amnesia which is frequently experienced after waking up from a dream. Last of all and in a more subjective sense, the general feeling of a DMT hallucination feels very dreamlike to me and is commonly described as such by many people.\"]},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"While there are some apparent aesthetic and behavioural differences between that of psychedelic internal hallucinations and normal dream states, in my opinion, these can be accounted for by the simultaneous occurrence of other subjective effects alongside these high-level internal hallucinations. For example, the simultaneous experience of psychedelic geometry during a hallucinatory state seems to result in it appearing to be physically comprised of ever-shifting and incomprehensibly complex condensed geometric forms in a manner which gives them their well known \\\"hyperspatial\\\" aesthetic. In terms of their behaviour, however, the simultaneous experience of an incredibly wide range of cognitive states such as ego death and various transpersonal effects seem to synergise and interplay with the specific effect of internal hallucinations in a manner which results in them displaying themes and concepts which would not ordinarily occur during normal dream states.\"]},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Another even more outlandish although less common claim is that DMT literally transports the user's consciousness to an alternate dimension or higher plane of transcendental existence in which the autonomous entities are it's real and living inhabitants. While this idea has likely been around for as long as DMT has been used by human beings, it was seemingly popularised by Terence Mckenna and his recounts of visiting \\\"machine elves\\\" within what he claimed was a real space which legitimately existed somewhere outside of the human subconscious. From his perspective, McKenna hypothesised that the DMT was potentially an access point to a parallel universe, a tool through which extraterrestrials use to communicate with us, a space in which human beings from the future reside, or an afterlife which contains an \\\"ecology of souls\\\" of previously living and unborn ancestral spirits.\"]},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"On some level, I can definitely empathise with these perspectives as it is easy for me to see how a person could come to these conclusions given how absolutely incomprehensible and profound many DMT experiences can be. However, it is still worth noting that for a variety of different reasons, these conclusions almost definitely arise as a result of undergoing the DMT experience without a general understanding of occums razor, critical thinking, and scepticism.  While these various forms of misinformation may seem relatively harmless, I would argue that spreading them as fact is harmful to our community as it gives people the impression that psychedelic users are irrational proponents of pseudoscientific ideas.\"]}]},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"hr\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":null},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"h2\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"See Also\"]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"ul\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"li\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[{\"name\":\"int-link\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"/effects\"},\"children\":[\"Subjective Effect Index\"]}]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"li\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[{\"name\":\"int-link\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"/articles/psychedelic-intensity-scale\"},\"children\":[\"Psychedelic Intensity Scale\"]}]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"li\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[{\"name\":\"int-link\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"/articles/dissociative-intensity-scale\"},\"children\":[\"Dissociative Intensity Scale\"]}]},\"\\n\"]},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"h3\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"External links\"]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"ul\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"li\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[{\"name\":\"ext-link\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulgin_Rating_Scale\"},\"children\":[\"Shulgin Rating Scale (Wikipedia)\"]}]},\"\\n\"]}]",53098,"unlisted",[],[],[],false,"DMT video script","dmt-video-script","61019f71bb4f7a63020e80cb","2022-05-02T21:56:58.183Z",2,"2022-05-17T01:46:36.405Z",1771021847312]
