The absence of such terminology has limited our ability to fully understand our own experiences and made discussion and research in this domain difficult. As a result of this need, over the past decade, myself and the greater subjective effect documentation community have been driven to volunteer countless hours of their free time to document their experiences and coin, define, and categorize terms, ultimately culminating in what is now known as the Subjective Effect Index, hosted on EffectIndex.com.[/p] \n\n[p]The Subjective Effect Index or (SEI) is a database of 233 effect descriptions that strives to serve as a comprehensive map of all potential experiences that can occur under the influence of any class of psychoactive compound, particularly hallucinogens. The existing SEI has been increasingly used to facilitate discussion within online psychedelic spaces since around 2012. However, it has not yet reached a level of completeness and polish that would allow it to serve as a universal terminology set. By improving and completing the SEI, we intend to create a tool that will improve our collective ability to research altered states of consciousness and greatly enhance the academic, clinical, therapeutic, personal, and cultural relevance of psychoactive compounds.[/p]\n\n[p]Under the employment of [ext-link to=\"https://www.mindstate.design/\"]Mindstate Design Labs[/ext-link], a Y Combinator startup, I am now leading a project to develop a new version of the SEI with unparalleled comprehensiveness and academic rigor. Experienced scientific researchers are serving as advisors throughout the index's development, these include [ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_S._Ray\"]Thomas S. Ray[/ext-link] a prominent psychedelic scientist who was a close friend of the late Alex Shulgin, [ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_B._Newberg\"]Andrew B.

It will incorporate a comprehensive literature review of other rudimentary altered state of consciousness ontologies, such as psychometric tools and informal classification systems found within books and online resources. We intend for this project to be fully open source so that it can become a ubiquitous resource analogous to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, providing a defined common lexicon so that researchers and laypeople alike can discuss altered states of consciousness in a succinct yet meaningful way.[/p]\n\n[p]Thanks to my employers, the creation of this particular aspect of the project is already underway. However, outside funding will be necessary to integrate the improved SEI into the Effect Index website and empower the Subjective Effect Documentation community to continue improving the index in our ever-evolving world. As a result of this, I am hoping to raise the necessary funds to hire a Web Developer so that we can both integrate this new ESEI into the site, and bring Effect Index to its full potential as a global source of subjective effect knowledge and discovery.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[p]The existing website has evolved over time through the generous contributions of multiple community volunteers, but it is presently not able to accommodate any significant changes to the overall structure of the content. While we have an excellent starting point with a powerful user interface, there are a number of important features and improvements that will need to be implemented to turn this project into a platform capable of serving as a dedicated community resource for establishing, showcasing, and progressing the field of Subjective Effect Documentation.[/p]\n\n[p]To maintain and implement improvements to the website, I would need to contract with a single freelance web developer, preferably on a long-term basis. My first choice for this role is a specific prominent community member who is highly capable, passionate about the project's goals, has an in-depth understanding of this project, is familiar with the website's backend code, and has been helping us work on it for a number of years.[/p]\n\n[p]For in-depth details on each aspect of the features we wish to implement and the estimated time it would take to do so, feel free to look at our spreadsheet [ext-link to=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAqiUgjzsbaZVaSJRJLKkWJ40Rug3QmL13fTE02Cw-M/edit?usp=sharing\"]here[/ext-link]. Otherwise, a summarised overview includes the following features.[/p]\n\n[li][i]User interface and profile improvements:[/i] Better, more customizable user profiles that would facilitate writers, artists, replicators, and other people involved within our community to showcase their contributions and general online presence, therefore encouraging higher-quality community contributions.[/li]\n[li]Upgrading the trip report editor to fix numerous issues to make writing trip reports easier and more accessible, this will be in the hopes of moving Effect Index towards becoming a centralized resource for the submission and curation of experience reports in a manner that will allow for them to be analysed through machine learning, and statistical analysis. All while remaining completely free and open source for researchers and private institutions alike to study freely.[/li]\n[li]We absolutely need to have the website fully prepared for the new effects and general overarching structure of the classification system by the time it is published and available to the public.[/li]\n[li]A directory of other all other Altered State of Consciousness Ontologies shown here, with direct comparison to the Subjective Effect Index. This will essentially be a user-facing showcase of the literature review that Josikinz is already working on with Mind State Design Labs.[/li]\n[li]And finally, a huge host of essential but smaller and less exciting improvements that will ultimately result in the creation of an extremely functional and refined platform.[/li]\n[hr /]\n\n[p]Depending on the number of features we are implementing and at an hourly rate of $X, we estimate that this platform overhaul would cost between 23-27,000 $'s to implement.
