The absence of such terminology has limited our ability to fully understand our own experiences and made discussion and research in this domain difficult. As a result of this need, over the past decade, myself and the greater subjective effect documentation community have been driven to volunteer countless hours of their free time to document their experiences and coin, define, and categorize terms, ultimately culminating in what is now known as the Subjective Effect Index, hosted on EffectIndex.com.[/p] \n\n[p]The Subjective Effect Index or (SEI) is a database of 233 effect descriptions that strives to serve as a comprehensive map of all potential experiences that can occur under the influence of any class of psychoactive compound, particularly hallucinogens. The existing SEI has been increasingly used to facilitate discussion within online psychedelic spaces since around 2012. However, it has not yet reached a level of completeness and polish that would allow it to serve as a universal terminology set. By improving and completing the SEI, we intend to create a tool that will improve our collective ability to research altered states of consciousness and greatly enhance the academic, clinical, therapeutic, personal, and cultural relevance of psychoactive compounds.[/p]\n\n[p]Under the employment of [ext-link to=\"https://www.mindstate.design/\"]Mindstate Design Labs[/ext-link], a Y Combinator startup, I am now leading a project to develop a new version of the SEI with unparalleled comprehensiveness and academic rigor. Experienced scientific researchers are serving as advisors throughout the index's development, these include [ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_S._Ray\"]Thomas S.

It will incorporate a comprehensive literature review of other rudimentary altered state of consciousness ontologies, such as psychometric tools and informal classification systems found within books and online resources. We intend for this project to be fully open source so that it can become a ubiquitous resource analogous to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, providing a defined common lexicon so that researchers and laypeople alike can discuss altered states of consciousness in a succinct yet meaningful way.[/p]\n\n[p]Thanks to my employers, the creation of this particular aspect of the project is already underway. However, outside funding will be necessary to integrate the improved SEI into the Effect Index website and empower the Subjective Effect Documentation community to continue improving the index in our ever-evolving world. As a result of this, I am hoping to raise the necessary funds to hire a Web Developer so that we can both integrate this new ESEI into the site, and bring Effect Index to its full potential as a global source of subjective effect knowledge and discovery.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[p]The existing website has evolved over time through the generous contributions of multiple community volunteers, but it is presently not able to accommodate any significant changes to the overall structure of the content. While we have an excellent starting point with a powerful user interface, there are a number of important features and improvements that will need to be implemented to turn this project into a platform capable of serving as a dedicated community resource for establishing, showcasing, and progressing the field of Subjective Effect Documentation.[/p]\n\n[p]To maintain and implement improvements to the website, I would need to contract with a single freelance web developer, preferably on a long-term basis.
