This will initially be achieved by the [int-link to=\"/profiles/Josie\"]site's founder[/int-link] employing her first-hand knowledge of hallucinogenic substances and the subjective effects they induce. Eventually we will establish a more refined methodology by employing a small team ingesting these substances at a range of dosages, and documenting their experiences through the use of standardized [int-link to=\"/reports/\"]trip reports[/int-link] using our [ext-link to=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/1VdkmHgkng78fPrpqIFd7qDti5B7ml_oD8ZFiHbid8w0/edit?usp=forms_home&ths=true\"]SEI form system[/ext-link]. We will then analyse this collected data in order to further detail and substantiate the effects that are induced at specific dosage ranges, their levels of intensity, style variations, and approximate frequency of occurrence.[/p]\n\n[p]DXM is a [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative hallucinogen[/int-link] within the morphinan chemical class. It is widely available for purchase at many pharmacies throughout the world in the form of cough syrup and tablets. The substance itself induces dissociative anaesthesia alongside significantly more psychedelic effects than that of other more traditional dissociatives, such as ketamine, PCP, and MXE. As this article will exclusively focus on this compound's subjective effects, if you would like to learn more about DXM's chemistry, pharmacology, history, legality, and potential dangers, then please see its PsychonautWiki article [ext-link to=\"https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM\"]here[/ext-link].[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Duration[/h2]\n\n[markdown text=\"**Total :** 8 - 12 hours* \n**Onset :** 30 - 120 minutes* \n**Come up :** 60 - 120 minutes* \n**Peak :** 3 - 6 hours* \n**Offset :** 2 - 4 hours* \n**After effects :** 4 - 24 hours\" /]\n[p]It is extremely important to note that the duration listed above applies to only the majority of people as DXM is metabolised through the CYP2D6 enzyme which has significantly reduced activity in approximately 10% of the population. This means that for certain individuals, DXM may be metabolised much more slowly than average in a manner which can result in a duration of up to 18-48 hours alongside of greatly increased uncomfortable side effects such as overstimulation and itchiness. This article assumes that the person ingesting DXM has a more normally functioning CYP2D6 enzyme.[/p]\n\n[p]The duration of DXM trips can also often be felt to be split into four separate phases which feel subjectively different from one another. The [i]first[/i] phase occurs while the user is still coming up on the substance. It typically consists of progressively more intense feelings of nausea and dissociative effects which culminate at the start of the peak with either vomiting and/or significantly reduced nausea. This nausea increases in its intensity proportional to the dosage consumed and is considerably more prevalent under the influence of DXM that comes in the form of cough syrup as opposed to pure powder or pills.[/p]\n\n[p]The [i]second phase[/i] lasts throughout the duration of the peak and can be described as feeling close to that of a traditional dissociative with a range of disconnective effects and cognitive suppressions. However, during the offset, the effects shift into the substances third phase in a manner which feels significantly more psychedelic, with an increase in high-level geometry, dream-like internal hallucinations, introspective thought patterns, and profound feelings of increased spirituality.[/p]\n\n[p]The final phase occurs during the day after the experience, once the user has slept. Depending on the individual's neurochemistry, it typically consists of either an afterglow or a hangover, with the afterglow feeling like an increase in energy, mania, mood elevation, and physical euphoria. This typically wears off approximately half way through the day and subsides into a general sense of sleepiness and lethargy. However, if the person is more prone to a hangover or has taken an overly heavy dosage, then they will likely experience feelings of lethargy, anxiety, inattentiveness, and mild depression. This will usually subside before the end of the day but may last multiple days in extreme cases.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Intensity scale[/h2]\n\n[p]This intensity scale breaks the subjective effects of DXM into seven distinct levels, in which each tier typically contains an expanding list of effects. These effects intensity proportionally to the dosage consumed. The approximate frequency of occurrence is also listed alongside each effect. For an explanation of the terms used within this frequency measuring system, please see the article [int-link to=\"/articles/approximate-frequency-of-occurrence-scale\"]here[/int-link]. Furthermore, it is important to note that the dosages provided here are average measurements that are comparable to recommendations made by [ext-link to=\"https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM\"]PsychonautWiki[/ext-link] and [ext-link to=\"https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_dose.shtml\"]Erowid[/ext-link]. The DXM dose required to reach a given range of effects seems to vary widely between individuals, depending on both body weight and neurochemistry. This variation in dosage sensitivity appears to be far more common among DXM users than almost any other hallucinogenic substance. For example, while some people may find themselves unusually sensitive to this compound, others will require a much higher dose than those recommended by this article and other reliable sources. It is therefore common for people within the psychonaut community to use [ext-link to=\"https://dxm.tripsit.me/\"]DXM calculators[/ext-link] which predict the required dosage depending on body weight. These dosage calculators usually refer to a 5 tier plateau system that was popularised in 2002 by [ext-link to=\"https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml\"]Erowid's DXM FAQ[/ext-link].[/p]\n\n[p]Although the levelling system documented on this page here is approximately—although not entirely—analogous to this plateau system, it is important to keep in mind that there are many subtle differences.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Subtle\" subHeader=\"(100 - 200 mg)\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n\nAt the lowest level, DXM frequently induces a small range of subtle [int-link to=\"/categories/cognitive-effects\"]cognitive effects[/int-link] which may be beneficial for enhancing a person's [int-link to=\"/effects/empathy-affection-and-sociability-enhancement\"]sociabilitity[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/stimulation\"]energy levels[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety-suppression\"]calmness[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/creativity-enhancement\"]creativity[/int-link]. \n\nThere may also be a sensation that the [int-link to=\"/effects/perception-of-bodily-lightness\"]body feels lighter[/int-link], resulting in a sense of bounciness and ease of movement. \nHowever, these changes may be difficult to distinguish between that of genuine alterations and the placebo effect, unless the person is already familiar with the substance. \nThis level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[ext-link to=\"https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.3\"]body feels lighter[/ext-link]\". \nThe specific subtle effects which generally occur at this level of intensity are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, listed below.\n\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[markdown text=\"* [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety-suppression\"]**Anxiety suppression**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/conceptual-thinking\"]**Conceptual thinking**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/creativity-enhancement\"]**Creativity enhancement**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/decreased-libido\"]**Increased libido**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/increased-sense-of-humor\"]**Increased sense of humor**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(uncommon)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/novelty-enhancement\"]**Novelty enhancement**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/perception-of-bodily-lightness\"]**Perception of bodily lightness**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/stimulation\"]**Stimulation**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(frequent)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/thought-acceleration\"]**Thought acceleration**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(frequent)\u003C/sup>\" /]\n\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Mild\" subHeader=\"(200 - 400 mg)\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n\nAt this level, the effects of DXM can be generally described as a subtle dulling of the senses and a vague feeling of [int-link to=\"/effects/physical-disconnection\"]physical detachment[/int-link] from the external environment, which is accompanied by a distinct sense of [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-euphoria\"]mood elevation[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/empathy-affection-and-sociability-enhancement\"]physical detachment[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/stimulation\"]stimulation[/int-link]. \n\nThe [int-link to=\"/effects/empathy-affection-and-sociability-enhancement\"]sociability enhancement[/int-link] experienced at this dosage range is mildly entactogenic and can be described as forcibly induced feelings of love, empathy, and talkativeness. Although it is comparable in its style to the entactogenia induced by substances such as MDMA, it is much subtler in its intensity and forcefulness in a manner which is similar to that of 2C-B. \n\nHowever, this effect is usually only present at these lower levels of intensity as when the dosage is increased, it eventually gives way to more typical dissociative effects.These effects are accompanied by mild but pleasurable spontaneous tactile sensations which are commonly referred to as a \"body high.\" The specific details of which can be described through its [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations#style-variations\"]style variations[/int-link] as *moving in motion, sporadic in consistency, sharp in sensation, euphoric in pleasurableness, and often localised in its position to the hands, feet, or head*.At this point, the user may have to pay direct attention to the effects of the substance for them to be recognisable, or they may be noticeable but will not necessarily demand the user's attention.This level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[second plateau](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.4)\".  \n\nThe specific subtle effects that generally occur at this level of intensity are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, listed below.\n\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-suppression\"]markdown text=\"#### Sensory* [**Auditory suppression**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/tactile-suppression\"]**Tactile suppression**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/tracers\"]**Tracers**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(level 1-2 / common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-acuity-suppression\"]**Visual acuity suppression**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(frequent)\u003C/sup>\" /][int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety-suppression\"]markdown text=\"#### Cognitive* [**Anxiety suppression**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-euphoria\"]**Cognitive euphoria**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/creativity-enhancement\"]**Creativity enhancement**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/conceptual-thinking\"]**Conceptual thinking**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/empathy-affection-and-sociability-enhancement\"]**Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/increased-sense-of-humor\"]**Increased sense of humor**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/novelty-enhancement\"]**Novelty enhancement**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/thought-acceleration\"]**Thought acceleration**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(frequent)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/increased-music-appreciation\"]**Increased music appreciation**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(frequent)\u003C/sup>\" /][int-link to=\"/effects/appetite-suppression\"]markdown text=\"#### Physical* [**Appetite suppression**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/dehydration\"]**Dehydation**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/decreased-libido\"]**Increased libido**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/motor-control-loss\"]**Motor control loss**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/nausea\"]**Nausea**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>  * [int-link to=\"/effects/nausea?s=vomiting\"]**Vomiting**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(uncommon)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]**Spontaneous tactile sensations**[/int-link]  \u003Csup>(level ~1 / frequent)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/stimulation\"]**Stimulation**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(frequent)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/perception-of-bodily-lightness\"]**Perception of bodily lightness**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(common)\u003C/sup>* [int-link to=\"/effects/pupil-dilation\"]**Pupil dilation**[/int-link] \u003Csup>(uncommon)\u003C/sup>\" /]\n\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Moderate\" subHeader=\"(400 - 700 mg)\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the environment starts to feel physically further away in distance and increasingly disconnected from a person’s sensory perception. \n\nPartially blurred and double vision sets in, and anaesthetic-like effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/tactile-suppression\"]tactile numbness[/int-link] begin to take place. Other physical faculties such as [int-link to=\"/effects/motor-control-loss\"]motor control, coordination, and balance[/int-link] become somewhat suppressed in a manner that is partially compensated for by a feeling of the body being in a state of \"autopilot\". Interestingly enough, this suppression of motor control is unique in its style as it frequently results in users moving around in a [int-link to=\"/effects/gait-alteration\"]robotic and mechanical-like gait[/int-link] that does not seem to present itself under the influence of other dissociative substances. \n\nWithin the DXM community, this is colloquially referred to as a \"robo walk\".These physical effects are also accompanied by a pronounced feeling of [int-link to=\"/effects/sedation\"]bodily sedation[/int-link] that begins to overtake the [int-link to=\"/effects/stimulation\"]stimulation[/int-link] that is felt at lower dosages, and is accompanied by other [int-link to=\"/categories/cognitive-suppressions\"]cognitive suppressions[/int-link] such as [int-link to=\"/effects/thought-deceleration\"]thought deceleration[/int-link]. However, this sedation should not be confused with a sense of actual [int-link to=\"/effects/sleepiness\"]sleepiness[/int-link] as it is more comparable to feeling extremely heavy and unable to move one's body. Alongside of this, the user will likely feel a sense of persistent [int-link to=\"/effects/dry-mouth\"]dry mouth[/int-link] or [int-link to=\"/effects/dehydration\"]mild dehydration[/int-link] that often requires periodic sipping of water to keep it from reaching significant levels of discomfort.Various adverse effects such as itching and rashes may also occur at this dosage range and above. \n\nAlthough it is uncommon, it is worth noting that a certain percentage of people seem to experience [int-link to=\"/effects/itchiness\"]itchiness[/int-link] on DXM that is comparable to that which occurs on opioids such morphine, kratom, and heroin. This is colloquially referred to as a \"robo itch\" within the DXM community and is likely a result of histamine release. In terms of auditory perception, the clarity of sound itself may seem as if it has become [int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-suppression\"]vague, muffled, and distant[/int-link]. Nonetheless, one's sense of [int-link to=\"/effects/increased-music-appreciation\"]music appreciation[/int-link] will have profoundly increased.  Regarding visual effects, some inconsistent and brief distortions may also occur spontaneously during dissociative experiences. \n\nThese distortions can include alterations in perceived distances between objects, visual segmentation of one's vision into glitch-like [int-link to=\"/effects/environmental-cubism\"]cubes[/int-link] or [int-link to=\"/effects/scenery-slicing\"]slices[/int-link], and changes to the perceived size of one's body or the environment.During this level, if one allows themselves to relax while closing their eyes, they may find that they are fleetingly and partially drifting off into a [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]darkened hallucinatory void[/int-link] filled with vague [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]psychedelic geometry[/int-link] alongside simplistic [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures\"]shapes, forms, and structures[/int-link]. \n\nThis is usually a very brief and indistinct experience, which can quickly be interrupted by external stimuli such as noises or other distractions.With DXM in particular, it is worth noting that its [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] is typically much more distinct, colourful, pronounced, and psychedelic-esque in comparison to that of other more commonly used dissociatives. Although it does not usually extend beyond level 5 geometry and is not entirely on par with a typical psychedelic in terms of complexity, it can often come very close in terms of its intensity, colour palette, and vividness. This effect will typically begin to manifest at this level subtly, and its intensity increases proportional to the dosage consumed. It can be comprehensively described through its [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry#style-variations\"]style variations[/int-link] as *intricate in complexity, algorithmic in style, unstructured in organization, brightly lit in lighting, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, small in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity*.There is also a distinct possibility that the user may experience stereotypical psychedelic drifting which causes the environment to appear to warp, morph, bend, and flow. However, although this effect is more common on DXM in comparison to that of other more common dissociatives, it is still substantially less common in comparison to that of a traditional psychedelic. The [int-link to=\"/effects/drifting#style-variations\"]style variations of this drifting[/int-link] are simple in complexity, slow-moving, smooth in perceived framerate, constant throughout, and unrealistic in its appearance.Depending on the person's level of experience with this substance, these effects can be allowed to occupy a predominant role within the person's perception, or they may be partially ignored and made somewhat secondary to other chosen activities.This level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[third plateau](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.7)\".

Common examples include *vast and monolithic pillars, columns, walls, tunnels, blocks, buildings, slides, monuments, wheels, pyramids, caverns, and a variety of abstract or fractal shapes*. The internal hallucinations that occur at this level will usually consist of vivid, ever-changing dream-like scenes and imagery. They can be comprehensively described through their [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination#style-variations\"]style variations[/int-link] as a combination of *lucid and delirious in awareness, fixed in style, primarily novel experiences over everyday or biographical content, autonomous in interactivity, and with a combination of both realistic and geometry based visual styles*.Although they are substantially less common than [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link] can also occasionally occur at heavy dosages of DXM. These are typically deliriant-like in nature and consist of solid hallucinations of objects or people blending seamlessly into the external environment. The most common theme seems to be the hallucination of conversing with other people in the environment who were not actually present throughout the trip. However, it is important to note that despite this effect being more common under the influence of DXM in comparison to that of other dissociatives, it is still quite rare and may never be experienced even by regular users.Alongside these disconnective hallucinatory effects, the user may experience feelings of altered cognition that feel as if they direct one's thought stream towards topics of [int-link to=\"/effects/introspection\"]introspection[/int-link], an [int-link to=\"/effects/analysis-enhancement\"]analysis of the details of their life[/int-link], and a general sense of [int-link to=\"/effects/spirituality-enhancement\"]spiritual or philosophical contemplation[/int-link].This is the level at which the effects become powerful enough to render the person undergoing them as [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]incapable of functioning, interacting normally, or thinking in a sober manner[/int-link]. At this level, the effects of the substance are apparent and can no longer be ignored in any capacity, leaving the user entirely engaged in the experience whether they wish to be or not. In terms of how this looks from an outsiders perspective, the person will usually appear to be either heavily sedated or almost entirely unconscious.This level of DXM intensity is roughly analogous to the lower end of a state which is colloquially referred to as the \"[fourth plateau](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.7)\".

headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]The highest level of detachment occurs when a person [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]loses all sensory awareness[/int-link] and semblance of normal cognitive functioning. This renders the person unconscious and consistently leaves extended gaps in a person’s memory with large periods of [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link] which are generally impossible to recall once the experience is over. It is at this level of dissociation that other dissociative substances such as ketamine are used in medical procedures for their anaesthetic effects.At this dosage range, the person will experience the effects typically associated with the previously described level during the onset and offset of their trip. During the peak, however, they will black out and become unconscious for a prolonged period of time that is directly proportional to the dosage consumed.Although this extreme dissociative state may be attractive to certain individuals, it is worth noting that this level of intensity is not only potentially dangerous but also less therapeutic and exploratory than the previous levels. With DXM in particular, it is said by sites such as [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_dose.shtml) that dosages between 2,500 mg and 20,000 mg are capable of resulting in death. However, this seems unusually high to me, and I would not personally be surprised if dosages closer to 1000mg were capable of causing a fatal overdose within certain individuals that have either a lower body weight or a higher sensitivity.[/headered-textbox][headered-textbox label=\"Level 7\" header=\"Prolonged\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]This state of DXM is not necessarily the highest level of the substances potential intensity but is qualitatively different from that of the previously listed levels. This state is induced by taking successive doses of DXM over several hours, instead of a single dose. It is reported to intensify many aspects of the DXM experience, and often produces more vivid and disorientating [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entity[/int-link] contact, [int-link to=\"/effects/delirium\"]delirium[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety\"]anxiety[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/psychosis\"]psychosis[/int-link] and many other extremely unpleasant side effects. Within the DXM community it is colloquially referred to as \"plateau sigma\" and was originally described in Erowid's 2002 [DXM FAQ](https://erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/faq/dxm_experience.shtml#toc.5.9). It is usually achieved using the following technique:1. Take a weak \"second plateau\" dosage at approximately 200-400 mg. It is recommended to do this earlier in the day due to the lengthiness of this process, as sleep deprivation or fatigue can negatively impact the experience.2. After approximately three hours (or about one hour after the peak) take another weak \"second plateau\" dosage.3. After another three hours (or about one hour after the second peak) take either a strong \"second plateau\" or a weak \"third plateau\" dosage at approximately 400-600mg.4. During the offset of this third dosage, the user may find themselves experiencing \"plateau sigma\" instead of slowly returning to baseline.However, it is important to note that within the DXM community, this experience is widely considered extremely unpleasant and potentially dangerous. There are seemingly very few cases of people who enjoy this state of mind. Because of these factors, it is universally advised that people avoid experimenting with it altogether.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[markdown text=\"### Experience reports\" /]Anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our experience index include:[int-link to=\"/reports/re-discovering-dxm\"]markdown text=\"- [**Re-discovering DXM**[/int-link] by [int-link to=\"/profiles/Josie\"]*Josie Kins*[/int-link]- [int-link to=\"/reports/heavy-dose-of-cough-syrup\"]**Heavy dose of cough syrup**[/int-link] by *Gabriel*\" /]\n\n[h2]Personal commentary[/h2]\n[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"]In my opinion, DXM is tragically overlooked and underrated by the mainstream psychonaut community. It is easily one of my favourite hallucinogens, as for me personally, it induces therapeutic introspection alongside profound feelings of spirituality enhancement in a manner that is more consistent than almost any of the other 120+ substances which I am experienced with. In fact, the only other hallucinogenic substance which is as consistently equal to me in this regard is ayahuasca.However, it is worth noting that I very much seem to be an outlier when it comes this. Over the years I have witnessed many other people under the influence of DXM, and while they usually hold it in high regard, only a small fraction of them seem to benefit from its effects to quite the same extent that I do. However, in an attempt to diminish my bias as much as possible, I have been sure to take this into account within the documentation above.I suspect the reason that I benefit from DXM so much stems from a combination of having a compatible physiology, as well the way in which its unique effect profile results in a trip which is seemingly 75% dissociative and 25% psychedelic — allowing me to simultaneously experience the positive aspects of both hallucinogenic classes, all within a single compound. I usually find that the first two-thirds of the experience is primarily dissociative in its effects with the last third being primarily psychedelic, with a headspace that also changes into something reminiscent of tryptamines. It's during this latter phase in which I typically undergo the aforementioned feelings of therapeutic introspection combined with a sense of profound and contemplative spiritual reverence towards my place within this universe.For many people, DXM seems to have a reputation of being a \"kiddie drug\" that presumably stems from a number of factors. For example, its ease of availability results in young teenagers commonly using or abusing this substance when they cannot access anything else. In addition to this, approximately 10% of users cannot metabolise it correctly which likely results in them reporting disproportionately adverse side effects that people fail to realise will not occur for the majority of the population. It is also commonly taken in the form of cough syrup which many people are understandably apprehensive about ingesting while remaining unaware that is also commonly available in other forms. Despite this reputation, however, DXM is an incredibly powerful hallucinogen that can potentially offer as much depth to it as any of the other classical dissociatives or hallucinogens. It's because of this that I would highly recommend any budding psychonaut to consider either revisiting this compound or giving it an honest try if they have yet to do so.[/quote]\n\n","[{\"name\":\"captioned-image\",\"properties\":{\"src\":\"/img/gallery/DXM.png\",\"width\":\"350\",\"caption\":\"Dextromethorphan molecule diagram.\",\"align\":\"right\",\"top\":\"true\",\"border\":\"true\"},\"children\":null},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"This article is part of an ongoing project to apply the \",{\"name\":\"int-link\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"/effects/\"},\"children\":[\"subjective effect index\"]},\" to specific psychoactive substances in order to document their phenomenological effects in a comprehensive and formalised manner.

With DXM in particular, it is said by sites such as [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dxm/dxm_dose.shtml) that dosages between 2,500 mg and 20,000 mg are capable of resulting in death.

It is usually achieved using the following technique:1. Take a weak \\\"second plateau\\\" dosage at approximately 200-400 mg. It is recommended to do this earlier in the day due to the lengthiness of this process, as sleep deprivation or fatigue can negatively impact the experience.2. After approximately three hours (or about one hour after the peak) take another weak \\\"second plateau\\\" dosage.3. After another three hours (or about one hour after the second peak) take either a strong \\\"second plateau\\\" or a weak \\\"third plateau\\\" dosage at approximately 400-600mg.4. During the offset of this third dosage, the user may find themselves experiencing \\\"plateau sigma\\\" instead of slowly returning to baseline.However, it is important to note that within the DXM community, this experience is widely considered extremely unpleasant and potentially dangerous. There are seemingly very few cases of people who enjoy this state of mind. Because of these factors, it is universally advised that people avoid experimenting with it altogether.\"]},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"markdown\",\"properties\":{\"text\":\"### Experience reports\"},\"children\":null},\"Anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our experience index include:\",{\"name\":\"int-link\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"/reports/re-discovering-dxm\"},\"children\":[\"markdown text=\\\"- [**Re-discovering DXM**\"]},\" by \",{\"name\":\"int-link\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"/profiles/Josie\"},\"children\":[\"*Josie Kins*\"]},\"- \",{\"name\":\"int-link\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"/reports/heavy-dose-of-cough-syrup\"},\"children\":[\"**Heavy dose of cough syrup**\"]},\" by *Gabriel*\\\" /]\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"h2\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Personal commentary\"]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"quote\",\"properties\":{\"author\":\"Josie Kins\",\"profile\":\"Josie\"},\"children\":[\"In my opinion, DXM is tragically overlooked and underrated by the mainstream psychonaut community. It is easily one of my favourite hallucinogens, as for me personally, it induces therapeutic introspection alongside profound feelings of spirituality enhancement in a manner that is more consistent than almost any of the other 120+ substances which I am experienced with. In fact, the only other hallucinogenic substance which is as consistently equal to me in this regard is ayahuasca.However, it is worth noting that I very much seem to be an outlier when it comes this. Over the years I have witnessed many other people under the influence of DXM, and while they usually hold it in high regard, only a small fraction of them seem to benefit from its effects to quite the same extent that I do. However, in an attempt to diminish my bias as much as possible, I have been sure to take this into account within the documentation above.I suspect the reason that I benefit from DXM so much stems from a combination of having a compatible physiology, as well the way in which its unique effect profile results in a trip which is seemingly 75% dissociative and 25% psychedelic — allowing me to simultaneously experience the positive aspects of both hallucinogenic classes, all within a single compound. I usually find that the first two-thirds of the experience is primarily dissociative in its effects with the last third being primarily psychedelic, with a headspace that also changes into something reminiscent of tryptamines. It's during this latter phase in which I typically undergo the aforementioned feelings of therapeutic introspection combined with a sense of profound and contemplative spiritual reverence towards my place within this universe.For many people, DXM seems to have a reputation of being a \\\"kiddie drug\\\" that presumably stems from a number of factors. For example, its ease of availability results in young teenagers commonly using or abusing this substance when they cannot access anything else. In addition to this, approximately 10% of users cannot metabolise it correctly which likely results in them reporting disproportionately adverse side effects that people fail to realise will not occur for the majority of the population. It is also commonly taken in the form of cough syrup which many people are understandably apprehensive about ingesting while remaining unaware that is also commonly available in other forms. Despite this reputation, however, DXM is an incredibly powerful hallucinogen that can potentially offer as much depth to it as any of the other classical dissociatives or hallucinogens. It's because of this that I would highly recommend any budding psychonaut to consider either revisiting this compound or giving it an honest try if they have yet to do so.\"]},\"\\n\\n\"]",52154,[11],{"_id":12,"bio_parsed":13,"tags":14,"not_public":15,"full_name":16,"alias":17,"email":18,"social_media":19,"bio":32,"gravatar_hash":37,"__v":38,"profile_url":39,"featured":15,"role":40,"profile_image":41},"60542430198361300fea3610",[],[],true,"Josie Kins","Josikinz","disregardeverythingisay@gmail.com",[20,24,28],{"type":21,"_id":22,"value":23},"reddit","60570f8534555a5df506dc55","https://reddit.com/u/josikins",{"type":25,"_id":26,"value":27},"twitter","60570f8534555a5df506dc56","https://twitter.com/josikinz",{"type":29,"_id":30,"value":31},"personal","61199fe868a28c38c14d411b","",{"_id":33,"length":34,"parsed":35,"raw":36},"64d05b22bc700c6d164d5fc9",472,"[{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Hey there, my name is Josie Kins.
