The absence of such terminology has limited our ability to fully understand our own experiences and made discussion and research in this domain difficult. People who have noticed this absence have been driven to volunteer countless hours of their free time to document their experiences and coin, define, and categorize terms, ultimately culminating in the Subjective Effect Index.[/p] \n\n[p]Effect Index is the website that hosts the [ext-link to=\"https://www.effectindex.com/effects\"]Subjective Effect Index[/ext-link] (SEI), a database of 233 effect descriptions that strives to serve as a comprehensive map of all potential experiences that can occur under the influence of any class of psychoactive compound, particularly hallucinogens. The existing SEI has been increasingly used to facilitate discussion within online psychedelic spaces since around 2012. However, it has not yet reached a level of completeness and polish that would allow it to serve as a universal terminology set. By improving and completing the SEI, we intend to create a tool that will improve our collective ability to research altered states of consciousness and greatly enhance the academic, clinical, therapeutic, personal, and cultural relevance of psychoactive compounds.[/p]\n\n[p]Under the employment of [ext-link to=\"https://www.mindstate.design/\"]Mindstate Design Labs[/ext-link], a Y Combinator startup, I am leading a project to develop a new version of the SEI with unparalleled comprehensiveness and academic rigor. Prominent scientific researchers such as [ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_S._Ray\"]Thomas S. Ray[/ext-link], [ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_B._Newberg\"]Andrew B. Newburg[/ext-link], and to a lesser extent [ext-link to=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.carhart-harris\"]Robin Carhart-Harris [/ext-link] are serving as advisors throughout the index's development, and it will be published as a publicly available open source research paper.[/p]\n\n[p]This project will greatly improve the overarching organisational structure of the Index and more than double the number of distinct defined effects. It will incorporate a comprehensive literature review of other rudimentary altered state of consciousness ontologies, such as psychometric tools and informal classification systems found within books and online resources. We intend for this project to be fully open source so that it can become a ubiquitous resource analogous to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, providing a defined common lexicon so that researchers and laypeople alike can discuss altered states of consciousness in a succinct yet meaningful way.[/p]\n\n[p]Thanks to my employers, the creation of this particular aspect of the project is already underway. However, new funding will be needed to integrate the improved SEI into the Effect Index website and empower the Subjective Effect Documentation community to continue improving the index in our ever-evolving world. This document details what we still need to bring Effect Index to its full potential as a global source of subjective effect knowledge and discovery.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[headered-textbox header=\"Web Development\" subHeader=\"($28,053 - $30,000)\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]My biggest priority for this project right now is improving the infrastructure behind our website. The existing website has evolved over time through the generous contributions of multiple community volunteers, but it is presently not able to accommodate any significant changes to the overall structure of the content.

The medications list should also be a separate list of meds and dosages, similar to how the substances box works. A more consistent time format would help with readability and ML processing.
