For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively their “ego” or a combination of their “ego” and physical body, during this state their sense of identity can change to include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. Alternatively, a person could feel as if their sense of self embodies nothing at all, which is an experience commonly referred to as [int-link to=\"/effects/depersonalization\"]depersonalization[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]There are a total of 5 distinct levels of identity which a person can experience. These various altered states of identity have been arranged into a levelling system that orders its different states from least to the most number of concepts one's identity is currently attributed to. These levels are described and documented below:[/p]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Total absence of attributed identity\" subHeader=\"depersonalization\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]The lowest level of identity can be described as the sensation that there is a complete absence of having any sense of self at all. This is referred to in psychiatry as \"[int-link to=\"/effects/depersonalization\"]depersonalization[/int-link]\". It can be described as an anomaly of self-awareness that consists of a feeling of watching oneself act as one normally would, while also feeling is if they have no control over the situation. During this state, the affected person may feel that they are \"on autopilot\" and that the world has become vague, dreamlike, less real, or lacking in significance. Individuals who experience depersonalization often feel divorced from their own personal physicality by no longer sensing their body sensations, feelings, emotions, and behaviours as belonging to a person or identity. It is also often claimed by people who have depersonalization that reality seems unreal, distant or hazy.[/p]\n\n[p]Depersonalization can sometimes be distressing to the user, who may become disoriented by the loss of a sense that their self is the origin of their thoughts and actions. However, it does not have to be an inherently negative altered state of awareness, as it does not directly affect one's emotions or thought patterns.[/p]\n\n[p]It is perfectly normal for many people to slip into this state temporarily, often without even realizing it. For example, many people often note that they enter a detached state of autopilot during stressful situations or when performing monotonous routine tasks such as driving.[/p]\n\n[p]Within the context of identity-altering effects, depersonalization can be considered as being at the opposite end of the identity spectrum relative to states of ##int-link|to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"{unity and interconnectedness}. This is because, during depersonalization, a person senses and attributes their identity to nothing, giving a sense of having no self. However, during a state of unity and interconnectedness, one senses and attributes their identity to everything, giving a sense that the entirety of existence is their self.[/p]\n\n[p]Depersonalization is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as anxiety and a very similar psychological disorder known as derealization. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] compounds, such as ketamine, PCP, and [int-link=\"/substances/dxm/\"]DXM[/int-link]. However, it can also occur to a lesser extent during the withdrawal symptoms of stimulants and depressants.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Self-contained separate identity\" subHeader=\"neurotypical ego's\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]The second level of identity can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to their brain and/or body. This is often said to feel as if one is a consciousness, the guiding force located within a body which is immersed in and interacting with a distinctly separate external environment. It is usually accompanied with a sense of free will or agency over all the thoughts and actions the person makes, which results in them feeling as if their decision-making processes are arising from an internal source which is not necessarily determined by cause and effect in the same manner as external systems.[/p]\n\n[p]A self-contained separate identity is by far the most common form of identity. Mainstream Western cultural notions consider this conception of identity to be the self-evident and logical way to perceive the world as well as the only form of identity which isn't intrinsically delusional. Despite being culturally normative, this belief has received considerable debate and criticism within modern neuroscience and philosophy.[/p]\n\n[p]Although drastically altered in comparison to that of sobriety, it is also worth noting that hallucinatory states such as ego replacement and 2nd person ##int-link|to=\"/effects/perspective-hallucination\"{perspective hallucinations} typically still fall under the classification of this level. In both cases, a person still feels as if they are a separate agent facing the external world, but have the perception of being a different identity than their sober self.\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Identifying with specific external systems\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]The third level of identity alteration can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to (in addition to the body and/or brain) specific external systems or concepts within the immediate environment, particularly those that would usually be considered as intrinsically separate from one's own being.[/p]\n\n[p]The experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the specific physical systems or concepts within the perceivable external environment which are currently the subjects of their thoughts or focus. This creates a sensation of becoming inextricably \"connected to\", \"one with\", \"the same as\", or \"unified\" with whatever the perceived external system happens to be.[/p]\n\n[p]There are an endless number of ways in which this level manifests itself, but common examples of the experience often include:[/p]\n\n##md{- Becoming unified with and identifying with a specific object one is interacting with.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with another person or multiple people, particularly common if engaging in sexual or romantic activities.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with the entirety of one's own physical body.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with large crowds of people, particularly common at raves and music festivals.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with the external environment, but not the people within it.}\nThis level of identity alteration most commonly occurs during intense states of focus, meditation, or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Identifying with all perceivable external\" systems\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]The fourth level of identity alteration can be defined as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to the entirety of their immediately perceivable external environment.[/p]\n\n[p]The experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the entirety of their sensory input or the currently perceivable external environment. It creates a sensation in the person that they have “become one with their surroundings.” This is felt to be the result of a person’s sense of self becoming attributed to not just primarily the internal narrative of the ego, but in equal measure to the body itself and everything around it which it is physically perceiving through the senses. This sensation creates the compelling perspective that the person is the external environment experiencing itself through a specific point within it, namely the physical sensory perceptions of the body their consciousness currently resides in.[/p]\n\n[p]It is at this point that a key component of the high-level identity alteration experience becomes an extremely noticeable factor. Once a person's sense of self has become attributed to the entirety of their surroundings, this new perspective completely changes how it feels to physically interact with what was previously felt to be an external environment. For example, when a person is not in this state and is interacting with a physical object, it typically feels as though they are a central agent acting on the separate world around them.[/p]\n\n[p]However, while undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object consistently feels as if the whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself with no central, separate agent operating the process of interaction. Instead, the process suddenly feels as if it has become completely decentralized and holistic, as the environment begins to autonomously and harmoniously respond to itself in a predetermined manner to perform the interaction carried out by the individual.[/p]\n\n[p]This level of identity alteration most commonly occurs during intense states of focus, meditation, or under the influence of hallucinogens such as ##int-link|to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"{psychedelics}.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Identifying with all known external systems\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n##cap-img|src=\"/img/gallery/Artistic_depiction_of_unity.png\"|top=\"true\"|border=\"true\"|width=\"250\"|artist=\"John Archibald Wheeler\"|title=\"Self Excited Circuit\"|caption=\"This symbol depicts the universe as a self-excited circuit. The eye represents an observer and the line directly opposite represents that which it is perceiving within the external environment. The two sections are connected into each other via arrows to demonstrate that they are a singular and unified system.\"|align=\"right\"The fifth level of identity alteration can be defined as feeling as if one's identity is simultaneously attributed to the entirety of the immediately perceivable external environment and all known concepts that exist outside of it. These known concepts typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe as it presently stands in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted by people as becoming one with the universe.\n\nWhen experienced, the effect creates the sudden perspective that the person is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through the specific point in space and time which this particular body and conscious perception happens to currently reside within. People who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of supposedly profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.”\n\nAlthough they are not necessarily literal truths about reality, at this point, many commonly reported conclusions of a religious and metaphysical nature often begin to manifest themselves as profound realizations. These are described below:\n\n##md{- The sudden and total acceptance of death as a fundamental complement of life. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of a person, but simply the end of this specific point of a greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist and live on through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as an inevitable, and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment, but simply a fact of reality.\n- The subjective perspective that the person's preconceived notions of \"god\" or deities can be felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all possible power (omnipotence), all possible knowledge (omniscience), is self-creating, and self-sustaining then on either a semantic or literal level the universe and its contents could also be viewed as god.\n- The subjective perspective that the person, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all of humanity's sufferings and flaws but also includes its acts of love and achievements.}\nThis state most commonly occurs during intense states of well-practiced meditation or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[h2 id=\"further-reading\"]Further reading[/h2]\n\n[p]Similar accounts of the experience of unity with the universe and the apparent illusory nature of the self can be found across a surprisingly large variety of independent religious, philosophical, and psychological sources.
