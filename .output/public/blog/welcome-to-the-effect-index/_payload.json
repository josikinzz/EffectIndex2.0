In doing so we may help to demystify the psychedelic experience, which has the potential to allow hallucinogen usage to become more culturally acceptable, better understood, and create a platform on top of which these substances may be more easily studied. For more information please see our [about](/about) page.\n\n~[The Effect Index team](/profiles)","welcome-to-the-effect-index",0,1771021847314]
