I am the person who created and wrote the subjective effect index. I also founded this website alongside of psychonautwiki.org and disregardeverythingisay.com. \n\nI am a 28-year-old British girl from Hastings, East Sussex who currently resides in Fort Collins, Colorado. I have dedicated my life to establishing the field of phenomenological subjective effect documentation and have founded this project in an attempt to popularise the topic.\n\nIf you need to contact or stalk me you can find my various handles below:\n\n- **Discord** - josikinz#1066\n- **Email** - disregardeverythingisay@gmail.com\n- **Reddit** - [/u/josikins](https://reddit.com/u/josikins)\n- **Twitter** - [@josikinz](https://twitter.com/Josikinz)",0,"josie.jpeg","josie.png",1,[14,26,36,43,51,58,66,73],{"_id":15,"associated_effects":16,"title":18,"artist":6,"artist_url":6,"description":19,"date":19,"resource":20,"thumbnail":19,"type":21,"url":22,"__v":12,"featured":23,"associated_substances":24,"person":25},"5b3a9696529d070e7344f790",[17],"5b22c509237ad007cf1363a3","Blurry English Housing","","https://pub-879bfd45a9774f1c80a8b77aca1f0aee.r2.dev/houses.jpg","image","blurry-english-housing",false,[],null,{"_id":27,"associated_effects":28,"featured":31,"url":32,"title":33,"artist":6,"artist_url":19,"description":19,"date":19,"resource":34,"thumbnail":19,"type":21,"__v":12,"associated_substances":35,"person":25},"5b8468d2ad2b550618d1afde",[29,30],"5b47acf0a1f46901e3750671","5b429377384b4958dbcd1a51",true,"lsd-in-hastings-country-park","LSD in Hastings Country Park","https://pub-879bfd45a9774f1c80a8b77aca1f0aee.r2.dev/hastings%20country%20park%20geometry.jpg",[],{"_id":37,"associated_effects":38,"title":39,"artist":6,"artist_url":19,"description":19,"date":19,"resource":40,"thumbnail":19,"type":21,"url":41,"__v":12,"featured":31,"associated_substances":42,"person":25},"5b4296f0384b4958dbcd1a59",[30],"Tree bark","https://pub-879bfd45a9774f1c80a8b77aca1f0aee.r2.dev/Symmetry_on_treebark_photos_v2_x2.jpg","tree-bark-2",[],{"_id":44,"associated_effects":45,"associated_substances":46,"featured":31,"url":47,"title":48,"artist":6,"artist_url":19,"description":19,"date":19,"resource":49,"thumbnail":19,"type":21,"__v":50,"person":25},"5d5c97ba18c4ef05ff7645de",[29,30],[],"paradise-valley","Paradise Valley","https://pub-879bfd45a9774f1c80a8b77aca1f0aee.r2.dev/paradise_valley.jpg",4,{"_id":52,"associated_effects":53,"title":54,"artist":6,"artist_url":6,"description":19,"date":19,"resource":55,"thumbnail":19,"type":21,"url":56,"__v":12,"featured":23,"associated_substances":57,"person":25},"5b32e10d7323db68ca54d237",[17],"Blurry Plushies","plushies.jpg MISSING","blurry-plushies",[],{"_id":59,"associated_effects":60,"title":61,"artist":6,"artist_url":62,"description":19,"date":19,"resource":63,"thumbnail":19,"type":21,"url":64,"__v":12,"featured":23,"associated_substances":65,"person":25},"5b31aedaf4339a609fea6d99",[17],"Blurry london","josie","https://pub-879bfd45a9774f1c80a8b77aca1f0aee.r2.dev/London_acuity_suppression.webp","blurry-london",[],{"_id":67,"associated_effects":68,"featured":23,"url":69,"title":70,"artist":6,"artist_url":19,"description":19,"date":19,"resource":71,"thumbnail":19,"type":21,"__v":12,"associated_substances":72,"person":25},"5c7c9c430b764c69a087d97d",[30],"horse-tooth-resevior","Horse Tooth Resevior","https://pub-879bfd45a9774f1c80a8b77aca1f0aee.r2.dev/horsestoothsymmetry.jpg",[],{"_id":74,"associated_effects":75,"title":77,"artist":6,"artist_url":78,"description":19,"date":19,"resource":79,"type":80,"url":81,"__v":12,"thumbnail":79,"featured":23,"associated_substances":82,"person":25},"5b2076dbb7c17b7f4edb095b",[76],"5b198863e60c9e06f06ddcf6","Colour Enhancement","http://www.someguy.com","c3u3dx","gfycat","colour-enhancement",[],1771021849079]
