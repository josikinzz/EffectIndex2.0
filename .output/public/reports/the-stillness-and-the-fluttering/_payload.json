They are similar to the tactile sensations in that they flash in and out, fleeting and fluttering. They are vivid amorphous blobs of color, not arranged in any particular pattern and not corresponding in any way to my normal visual stimuli. Eventually faint thick tendrils begin to seep in as the dominant visual, subtly turning the world into a gummy tangle. Otherwise, it seems like I’m looking through glasses that make the world clearer-perspective is a bit distorted but everything appears in high definition and is rippling. I feel very stimulated and restless, which along with chills lends to some slight discomfort.",{"_id":56,"time":57,"description":58},"5ce9a79ce573c21b63a2a725","T4:00","It feels like my mind has just been soaking in a big cold damp psychedelic blanket. I cannot really form coherent thoughts or articulate things. It is different than the usual mental acuity that comes with psychedelics, it’s as though my mind is in such a different void of a place that trying to reconcile that with my stimuli and memories is pointless. I have an alien mind in a familiar world, and the dissonance just creates static. I decide that I’m still not deep enough, and decide to take 2 huge hits from my gravity bong.",{"_id":60,"time":61,"description":62},"5ce9a79ce573c21b63a2a724","T4:30","I underestimated this chemical heavily… The visuals were and still are pretty light and I took that to correlate directly with the cognitive aspect. What followed is still somewhat inexplicable. It felt like a dissociative, but crawling with alien life. With my eyes closed, the ‘visuals’ were ethereal and vague and honestly couldn’t be considered visuals but some strange synesthetic aesthetic experience wired directly into my brain, no stimuli or even hallucinated stimuli, just pure void and essence. My body would just fade when I closed my eyes, no pleasurable tactile sensations, just total absence. It felt like my mind was forming a gravity well and sinking into existence. Any attempts at using some internal narration failed, it was as if my ability to use words had just died. I rode this out for about an hour and then went outside to listen to music and enjoy the sky. There were those same swirly tendril patterns in the sky and more flashes of color, some of them corresponding to the forms of the patterns. The tactile sensations had more or less faded. Music was fascinating, it was like the feeling I get from listening to music stoned where I can pick out every sound and every layer of carefully placed instruments and voices, but amplified tenfold, I could intensify my focus on certain elements of the soundscape and isolate them in my mind.",[64,68],{"_id":65,"time":66,"description":67},"5ce9a79ce573c21b63a2a72a","T6:00","I was mostly down by now, unlike the usual comedown from psychedelics where I feel especially social and have increased mental acuity, I mostly just felt drained and eroded. One thing to note during the comedown was INTENSE muscular discomfort, just a great deal of aching and restless leg syndrome and that feeling of never being comfortable.",{"_id":69,"time":70,"description":71},"5ce9a79ce573c21b63a2a729","T7:00","Back to baseline I think.","This would be my first foray into the 5-MeO-Tryptamines and I would later come to understand them as their own class of drug entirely. They are incomparable to other psychedelics for several reasons- The first is a lack of sensory stimulation and distortions until higher doses are reached, and even then the effects are subtle and odd. They do not follow the patterns or harmonies of traditional psychedelic visual effects- rather they are vague, disconnected, and extremely abstract. The headspace is unlike anything else, it’s a blank neutrality and a sense of suppression of the normal channels of psychedelic thought. It’s not entirely as though these chains of thought have been rendered blank, but rather they have been rerouted into esoteric territory that defies proper comprehension- it’s a profound alteration that leaves the mind unsure of how to react. The physical effects of this drug in particular feature a great deal of stimulation and hallucinated tactile sensations, moreso than any other psychedelic I’ve taken. I’m not entirely sure what utilitarian value I could apply to this substance personally, it’s just so odd. The leg pain on the comedown was interesting too.\n",{"subject":74,"substances":74,"onset":74,"peak":74,"offset":74,"introduction":74,"description":9,"conclusion":74,"tags":74,"relatedEffects":74},true,3,[77,87,94,100,106,111],{"_id":78,"name":79,"url":80,"tags":81},"5b198863e60c9e06f06ddcf6","Colour enhancement","colour-enhancement",[82,83,84,85,86],"amplification","enhancement","psychedelic","sensory","visual",{"_id":88,"name":89,"url":90,"tags":91},"5b75cde36b7b4d388828c645","Stimulation","stimulation",[82,83,92,93],"miscellaneous","physical",{"_id":95,"name":96,"url":97,"tags":98},"5b2839b3809a7131085cf527","Drifting","drifting",[99,84,85,86],"distortion",{"_id":101,"name":102,"url":103,"tags":104},"5b49a89bea24120b49b24b58","Spontaneous tactile sensations","spontaneous-tactile-sensations",[92,84,85,105],"tactile",{"_id":107,"name":108,"url":109,"tags":110},"5ae0195b9c6a943598b215e9","Visual acuity enhancement","visual-acuity-enhancement",[82,83,84,85,86],{"_id":112,"name":113,"url":114,"tags":115},"5b47acf0a1f46901e3750671","Geometry","geometry",[116,114,84,85,86],"geometric",null,1771021849886]
