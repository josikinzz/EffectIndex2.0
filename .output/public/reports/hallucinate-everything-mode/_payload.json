I completely separated from my body and saw thousands upon thousands of extraordinarily vivid and detailed scenes of places, entities, and genuinely incomprehensible forms. I both saw these scenes in front of me and became them. I could feel every single detail of these vivid hallucinations as if they were my own body. They were more complex and detailed than anything that could possibly exist in the \"real\" world. A significant percentage of their forms defied all logic and appeared to be impossibly shaped. \n\nThe sheer intensity and amount of the breathtaking, incredible scenes eventually began to leave me completely overwhelmed with sensory overload.

I noticed that I could not entirely focus on complex high-level tasks such as proofreading the subjective effect index. However, routine tasks such as performing my job and interacting with people were perfectly fine. I actually felt quite mentally refreshed.","This trip was an absolutely mindblowing experience and easily the hardest I have tripped in over two years. It seems that somewhere in the mind, there is a button that triggers the brain into activating a \"complete simulate render 3D hallucinate everything mode\". 2C-E somehow presses this button perfectly.\n\nI am completely baffled that the brain is even capable of rendering thousands upon thousands of scenes which are so detailed, intricate, and vivid that they are incomprehensible beyond anything which could ever occur within the real world. What possible evolutionary advantage could the presence of this mode of action have? Especially considering that it is usually only activated during the most obscure of situations, such as ingesting a synthetic phenethylamine psychedelic. These compounds could do a fraction of what they are capable of, and they would still be one of the most profound experiences available to a human being. \n\nThis trip truly pushed myself to the limits of what I could withstand and reignited my respect for these compounds. Although I could likely tolerate a heavier dosage of 2C-E, there would be no point as it would probably just involve me passing out into unconsciousness.\n\nFor my next hallucinogenic experiences, I will be ingesting Salvia divinorum at a wide range of dosages and documenting the results.\n\nThanks for reading.",{"subject":153,"substances":153,"onset":153,"peak":153,"offset":153,"introduction":154,"description":154,"conclusion":153,"tags":153,"relatedEffects":153},true,false,"hallucinate-everything-mode",6,[158,169,174,179,189,198,204,212,219,225,231,236,241,246,251,256,261,266,272,278,284],{"_id":159,"name":160,"url":161,"tags":162},"5b7b474439b82210cf57a610","Nausea","nausea",[163,164,165,166,167,168],"bodily","deliriant","miscellaneous","physical","psychedelic","uncomfortable",{"_id":170,"name":171,"url":172,"tags":173},"5b85a4c0fc5e853400adc52d","Teeth grinding","teeth-grinding",[163,166,168],{"_id":175,"name":176,"url":177,"tags":178},"5b84a8e20fa2f30491ca9964","Diarrhea","diarrhea",[163,166,168],{"_id":180,"name":181,"url":182,"tags":183},"5b4a9aa157e0ac1a83ac634d","Thought acceleration","thought-acceleration",[184,185,186,187,188],"amplification","cognitive","enhancement","nootropic","stimulant",{"_id":190,"name":191,"url":192,"tags":193},"5b49b63dc96f86189926904a","Gustatory hallucination","gustatory-hallucination",[164,194,195,167,196,197],"gustatory","hallucinatory state","sensory","smell and taste",{"_id":199,"name":200,"url":201,"tags":202},"5b49a89bea24120b49b24b58","Spontaneous tactile sensations","spontaneous-tactile-sensations",[165,167,196,203],"tactile",{"_id":205,"name":206,"url":207,"tags":208},"5b54ec3a2c47507065db131c","Analysis suppression","analysis-suppression",[209,185,210,211],"antipsychotic","depressant","suppression",{"_id":213,"name":214,"url":215,"tags":216},"5b2839b3809a7131085cf527","Drifting","drifting",[217,167,196,218],"distortion","visual",{"_id":220,"name":221,"url":222,"tags":223},"5b8361b480b3d80353a05412","Temperature regulation suppression","temperature-regulation-suppression",[224,166,168],"neurological",{"_id":226,"name":227,"url":228,"tags":229},"5b47acf0a1f46901e3750671","Geometry","geometry",[230,228,167,196,218],"geometric",{"_id":232,"name":233,"url":234,"tags":235},"5b84af7790c764228078e485","Increased salivation","increased-salivation",[163,166,168],{"_id":237,"name":238,"url":239,"tags":240},"5b81bfe4f228e642f0829cf1","Difficulty urinating","difficulty-urinating",[163,164,166,168],{"_id":242,"name":243,"url":244,"tags":245},"5b8597d4a9a7f02682462a0d","Stomach bloating","stomach-bloating",[163,166,168],{"_id":247,"name":248,"url":249,"tags":250},"5b75cde36b7b4d388828c645","Stimulation","stimulation",[184,186,165,166],{"_id":252,"name":253,"url":254,"tags":255},"5b84a2ca0fa2f30491ca9960","Back pain","back-pain",[163,166,168],{"_id":257,"name":258,"url":259,"tags":260},"5b85a776fc5e853400adc52e","Temporary erectile dysfunction","temporary-erectile-dysfunction",[163,166,168],{"_id":262,"name":263,"url":264,"tags":265},"5b218d716d91db1503c9e969","Increased pareidolia","increased-pareidolia",[184,186,167,196,218],{"_id":267,"name":268,"url":269,"tags":270},"5b4664069b173e7348c5cb0e","Internal hallucination","internal-hallucination",[164,271,195,167,196,218],"dissociative",{"_id":273,"name":274,"url":275,"tags":276},"5b46bfc891d66d7e5521b0b0","Settings, sceneries, and landscapes","settings-sceneries-and-landscapes",[164,195,277,196,218],"hallucinogenic",{"_id":279,"name":280,"url":281,"tags":282},"5b832caff228e642f0829cf9","Increased heart rate","increased-heart-rate",[283,166,168],"cardiovascular",{"_id":285,"name":286,"url":287,"tags":288},"5fb2d59784bcbf393b0c3839","Ego death","ego-death",[185,271,167,289],"transpersonal state",{"_id":291,"bio_parsed":292,"tags":293,"not_public":153,"full_name":294,"alias":295,"email":296,"social_media":297,"bio":310,"gravatar_hash":315,"__v":316,"profile_url":317,"featured":153,"role":318,"profile_image":319},"60542430198361300fea3610",[],[],"Josie Kins","Josikinz","disregardeverythingisay@gmail.com",[298,302,306],{"type":299,"_id":300,"value":301},"reddit","60570f8534555a5df506dc55","https://reddit.com/u/josikins",{"type":303,"_id":304,"value":305},"twitter","60570f8534555a5df506dc56","https://twitter.com/josikinz",{"type":307,"_id":308,"value":309},"personal","61199fe868a28c38c14d411b","",{"_id":311,"length":312,"parsed":313,"raw":314},"64d05b22bc700c6d164d5fc9",472,"[{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Hey there, my name is Josie Kins.
