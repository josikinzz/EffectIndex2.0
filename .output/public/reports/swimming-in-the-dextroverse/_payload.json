Each time I washed my face with cold water, it felt calming in a way. I couldn't really feel the water afterwards, though I could touch my face with my hands and feel it was wet. Just had a slight tingling sensation and the droplets of water that I could feel influenced the patterns of the CEVs, which was really interesting. Walking was hard, and because I haven't seen it described in DXM trip reports before I'd like to go into it. Opening and closing doors is a hit or miss because I simply don't understand how much effort it takes to open and close it, or more accurately, I feel entirely weightless and doing anything of the sort is entirely effortless. I'd bet a punch from someone on DXM would hurt really hard given just how much you underestimate your strength on it. Hilariously enough, the robowalk is very real and results in having to hold onto something while getting up, and I got into bed by basically throwing myself against it.

Text doesn't really do it justice, the body euphoria was extremely nice, as was feeling like I was floating or swimming at times. I'd like to experience it again in a couple of weeks, and in the meanwhile I'm hoping the dissociation from the experience will help me control dissociation while entirely sober.\n\nI would like to touch on just how nice the entire experience was despite not really talking about current emotion all that much in the report, all in all it was extremely euphoric and warm, put me into a very cuddly mood and I was just overall extremely happy. I was fairly surprised early on how I felt, considering how I had felt earlier I didn't expect it to pick up my mood by that much, and that feeling extended far into the afterglow. Currently still very content as of 17:18, just taking a lot of time to organize my thoughts and emotions.\n\nDuring the several hour peak I was very enjoyably dissociated, and I think this is the first time I've let myself just entirely let go. Just leave my fate to the metaphorical ocean which I was swimming in. \n\nI was just in pure bliss, entirely relaxed and just enjoying not having to worry about anything, and enjoying being in a sociable and almost stupidly happy state.\n\nI've also been really glad to have been able to do reflection on myself, and been more motivated to work on fixing my own problems than I was before, as any form of motivation was a problem before. It also helps to now have all those problems just presented to me like a list to fix and check off one by one, without needing to worry about how much progress I've made or not wanting to start because it's no longer as daunting as it seemed before.\n\nI'd also like to reiterate how words don't do nearly enough justice to the entire experience, I know it's something I'll savor and learn from for quite a while.
