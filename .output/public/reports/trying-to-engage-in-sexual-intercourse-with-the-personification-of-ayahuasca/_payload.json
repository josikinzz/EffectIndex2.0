The first hallucination.",[27],{"_id":28,"time":24,"description":29},"5f80b3c09ebb180c1d4e7473","I was trying to engage in sexual intercourse with the personification of Ayahuasca, which was a large 3D cylinder made entirely of visuals, with a few arm-like protrusions at random points. Ayahuasca was having none of it, and I didn’t want to force myself upon her and end the trip early or shame myself, so I ceased. I opened my eyes, looked around the room, and went back under the jumper. The second hallucination.\n\nI was looking into the dirty, messy living room of a house I had never seen before, and saw an overweight humanoid in a baseball cap and ill-fitting t-shirt watching TV on an armchair. This was another personification of Ayahuasca, but this one was male. Everything in this hallucination was made of different shades of blue, including Ayahuasca. I realised this was Ayahuasca, “So you’re a dude! Sorry about earlier, I always thought of you as a sexy female temptress” I thought/said. He seemed cool about the whole mix-up. It turned out he was an overweight teenager, and was a massive stoner. He proceeded to take my hand and show me where he lived, so we flew in the sky like Superman above his house. The house was atop a huge cliff that was perfectly smooth and semi-circular. Beneath the front garden was a sheer drop thousands of miles deep, which looked like an endless abyss. Ayahuasca told me he likes to trip and stare into the abyss to see the visuals.\n\nThe third hallucination, including the build-up.\n\nFor some reason the stoner Ayahuasca hallucination stopped, so I went upstairs where my friend Josikins tested her strobe light on me; eyes closed but with my face close to the strobe light, for a few flashes there were geometric, wire-y visuals, but they ended quickly and it was just a strobe light again. We went into the bathroom together, as it had no windows and was the darkest room in the house, kept the lights off and chatted for a bit. I told her about my hallucination, and she was telling me something (but I can’t remember what), and then left. Only a few seconds passed with me in total darkness and utter silence, but I started hearing music (it sounded very similar to the first 45 seconds of ‘No Quarter’ by Led Zeppelin), and I was lifted out of my body – utterly DMT-like! This hallucination, however brief, was the most vivid and real one I have ever experienced (and I was once convinced that I was a medical book with a few pages missing when I had a fever once). The content wasn’t constructed out of visuals, everything looked perfectly real. I was in the sky, among the clouds, jumping fantastically high and for long distances, using rogue clouds as stepping stones. In the distance was an enormous castle which looked very similar in structure to the one you see in the beginning of Disney credits, only this one was made of crystal and was refracting/deflecting light like a prism, which covered the castle in a flowing rainbow. It was beautiful. I jumped over a few more clouds, trying to make it to the castle, but missed one and fell. I was among lower clouds, covering the sky like a blanket, and I was slowly sinking beneath them. I had one hand outstretched, trying to reach the castle, and I saw dozens of other hands doing the same thing around me. I was eventually submerged beneath the clouds, and that was me back in the bathroom in the dark, smiling insanely.

That was, effectively, the end of my trip (just the fibre of light overlaying everything was left).",{"subject":35,"substances":35,"onset":35,"peak":35,"offset":35,"introduction":8,"description":8,"conclusion":35,"tags":35,"relatedEffects":35},true,4,[38,47,55,60,67],{"_id":39,"name":40,"url":41,"tags":42},"5b47acf0a1f46901e3750671","Geometry","geometry",[43,41,44,45,46],"geometric","psychedelic","sensory","visual",{"_id":48,"name":49,"url":50,"tags":51},"5b4664069b173e7348c5cb0e","Internal hallucination","internal-hallucination",[52,53,54,44,45,46],"deliriant","dissociative","hallucinatory state",{"_id":56,"name":57,"url":58,"tags":59},"5b43d2798b36395c8633903a","Autonomous entity","autonomous-entity",[52,54,44,45,46],{"_id":61,"name":62,"url":63,"tags":64},"5b49a59cea24120b49b24b54","Auditory hallucination","auditory-hallucination",[65,52,54,66,44,45],"auditory","miscellaneous",{"_id":68,"name":69,"url":70,"tags":71},"5b49be99c96f861899269051","Scenarios and plots","scenarios-and-plots",[54,66,72,44,45],"multisensory",null,1771021849909]
