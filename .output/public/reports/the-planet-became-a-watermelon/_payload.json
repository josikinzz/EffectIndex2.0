I was inhaling DMT via a bong, but as it was intended for someone else it had tobacco in it. When I took over, it was very hard to keep down; like when you’re so full but you have to force the next forkful down for whatever reason. After a few deep breaths of the stuff, my friend (Josikins) just told me “One more pull, man”, and it felt like I was in a Hollywood film and was up against it. I inhaled and rushed the bong, and instead of inhaling smoke that tastes like burning plastic, it was like I inhaled a dog of crisp sea air, and I could sense sparkles and every salt particle. That’s about when some visuals resembling a monochrome dream catcher materialized in front of me, taking up my entire field of vision. Colours quickly filled this and I was in.",[27],{"_id":28,"time":24,"description":29},"5f8111109ebb180c1d4e74a5","I was lifted out of my body very quickly, and landed in another world, one made entirely of multi-colored, luminous, ever-changing ‘generic digital’ or LED lights, though despite literally everything being made of this light (land, sky, everything within) I could make out that I was wandering around a walled maze (just like the 3D maze screensaver on Windows 98, but made entirely out of ever-changing color). I was only here for a matter of seconds. I then saw a ‘blocky’ wall of light move like a wave from left to right – if ocean waves were on Minecraft they would look like this, very blocky and simple. The wave had a pair of cartoon eyes, like Goofy or Donald Duck or whatever.\n\nAfter this I was drifting from the planet’s surface and ended up looking at a bright orange globe from space. After this I heard someone in the room say something, so I opened my eyes and I saw in splitscreen reality on the upper half, and my DMT trip carrying on without my attention beneath. That was kind of like when you’re swimming in goggles and you lift your head out of the water just enough so that you can see above and below surface. The real world was rather dull in comparison, so I closed my eyes and carried on. I drifted away some more and then saw that the planet was inside a watermelon, vines and all, and I had just exited the planet’s atmosphere like I imagine anything else would, but the atmosphere here was quite clearly a watermelon. I drifted further away and everything was dark.",[31],{"_id":32,"time":24,"description":33},"5f8111109ebb180c1d4e74a6","For some reason I then felt a little sad at how few people, in the grand scheme of things, have and would ever experience a DMT trip. When I’m tripping I often think of how something like a DMT trip (or any psychedelic experience) undoubtedly started the earliest religions. The evidence was… evident! So I think that explains why I then saw an army of cavemen, made entirely of the aforementioned, ever-changing light, carrying a banner of ever-changing color, march proudly towards the orange globe in deep space. I reckon I was convincing myself that DMT and the whole psychedelic experience will carry on as long as there are even a few proponents. After this revelation my trip stopped; reality appeared to have been ‘poured’ over my trip, over my field of vision. There were even vibrantly colored visuals on the extreme periphery of my vision for a few seconds after.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice evening in.",{"subject":35,"substances":35,"onset":35,"peak":35,"offset":35,"introduction":8,"description":8,"conclusion":8,"tags":35,"relatedEffects":35},true,1,[38,47],{"_id":39,"name":40,"url":41,"tags":42},"5b47acf0a1f46901e3750671","Geometry","geometry",[43,41,44,45,46],"geometric","psychedelic","sensory","visual",{"_id":48,"name":49,"url":50,"tags":51},"5b4664069b173e7348c5cb0e","Internal hallucination","internal-hallucination",[52,53,54,44,45,46],"deliriant","dissociative","hallucinatory state",null,1771021849881]
