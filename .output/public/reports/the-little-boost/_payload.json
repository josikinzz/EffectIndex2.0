I notice the visual effects used in the show strongly resemble the experience of being on dissociatives, especially DXM. I begin to think about that state and it almost feels like I’m replicating it just by thinking about it. Visuals are flashing in red and green, they are boldest when I blink really fast. CEV’s seem like pretty mild swirling and patterning, and OEV’s are faint patterns on the walls, reminiscent of 2C-B. Auditory effects come in the sense of losing all depth, with far away things sounding close by, with some echoing and reverb. Mentally, I am very lucid, it feels like being very stoned, I am pretty spacey and dazed and my mind wanders a lot. However it feels “clearer” and “sharper”, like the fogginess of being stoned is gone.

I’m not really paying attention for most of it, the whole thing is in German with no English subtitles. Its hard for me to tell whats going on, I keep getting distracted. I’m seeing patterns appear in the background of the movie and it looks like its extra high def. The dark room also fosters flashing red and green patterns. I’m still very lucid. There feels like a very slight increase in sociability, less anxious than usual but thats it really.
