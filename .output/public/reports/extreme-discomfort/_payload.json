The Xanax has offset the all of the physical and cognitive side effects, and the CBD has successfully counteracted the vasoconstriction. I am now tripping much harder but have concluded that documentation from this point forward is not worthwhile as I am no longer able to document the LSA alone. ","For me personally, LSA is quite likely the worst psychedelic I have ever taken. Out of the many hallucinogenic substances which I have tried, this substance was easily one of the worst regarding its physical discomfort, which was very disproportionately intense relative to the mild visual and cognitive effects I was experiencing. In terms of discomfort, I would even rank it up there with some of my DPH trips. In the future, I will not be ingesting this compound again without first making a purified tincture from my large collection of morning glory seeds. I am hoping that this will perhaps offset many of the side effects.\n\nIn the meantime, I now consider this trip to be a partially failed experiment. This is due to being forced to combine it with other substances which sullied the documentation process. However, it was still useful for learning more about LSA and how I should approach this compound in the sure.\n\nThanks for reading.",{"subject":89,"substances":89,"onset":89,"peak":89,"offset":89,"introduction":90,"description":90,"conclusion":89,"tags":89,"relatedEffects":89},true,false,4,[93,100,108,115,122,128,137,144,151,157,162,167],{"_id":94,"name":95,"url":96,"tags":97},"5b8597d4a9a7f02682462a0d","Stomach bloating","stomach-bloating",[98,99,16],"bodily","physical",{"_id":101,"name":102,"url":103,"tags":104},"5b7b474439b82210cf57a610","Nausea","nausea",[98,105,106,99,107,16],"deliriant","miscellaneous","psychedelic",{"_id":109,"name":110,"url":111,"tags":112},"5b49a89bea24120b49b24b58","Spontaneous tactile sensations","spontaneous-tactile-sensations",[106,107,113,114],"sensory","tactile",{"_id":116,"name":117,"url":118,"tags":119},"5b49a0f1ea24120b49b24b52","Auditory enhancement","auditory-enhancement",[120,121,106,107,113],"auditory","enhancement",{"_id":123,"name":124,"url":125,"tags":126},"5b70ac9c6a045869c5d09a89","Increased libido","increased-libido",[127,121,99],"amplification",{"_id":129,"name":130,"url":131,"tags":132},"5b57737f7b8699458496cc8d","Cognitive euphoria","cognitive-euphoria",[133,134,135,136],"cognitive","entactogen","novel","opioid",{"_id":138,"name":139,"url":140,"tags":141},"5b47acf0a1f46901e3750671","Geometry","geometry",[142,140,107,113,143],"geometric","visual",{"_id":145,"name":146,"url":147,"tags":148},"5b60d774f8650203ba48b050","Introspection","introspection",[133,149,107,150],"dissociative","psychological state",{"_id":152,"name":153,"url":154,"tags":155},"5b4a5cba57e0ac1a83ac633c","Anxiety","anxiety",[127,156,133,105,121,107],"cannabinoid",{"_id":158,"name":159,"url":160,"tags":161},"5b5b61e1e38ad064dc90b0c3","Time distortion","time-distortion",[133,135,107],{"_id":163,"name":164,"url":165,"tags":166},"5b84b75ea9a7f02682462a06","Muscle tension","muscle-tension",[98,99,16],{"_id":168,"name":169,"url":170,"tags":171},"5b832006d9d9734437b319a4","Vasoconstriction","vasoconstriction",[172,99,16],"cardiovascular",{"_id":174,"bio_parsed":175,"tags":176,"not_public":89,"full_name":177,"alias":178,"email":179,"social_media":180,"bio":193,"gravatar_hash":198,"__v":199,"profile_url":200,"featured":89,"role":201,"profile_image":202},"60542430198361300fea3610",[],[],"Josie Kins","Josikinz","disregardeverythingisay@gmail.com",[181,185,189],{"type":182,"_id":183,"value":184},"reddit","60570f8534555a5df506dc55","https://reddit.com/u/josikins",{"type":186,"_id":187,"value":188},"twitter","60570f8534555a5df506dc56","https://twitter.com/josikinz",{"type":190,"_id":191,"value":192},"personal","61199fe868a28c38c14d411b","",{"_id":194,"length":195,"parsed":196,"raw":197},"64d05b22bc700c6d164d5fc9",472,"[{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Hey there, my name is Josie Kins.
