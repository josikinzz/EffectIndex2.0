I got really scared because I was less than an hour in and already in way over my head. (When I usually trip, the peak happens exactly at three hours. I thought this trip was going to be the same, so I think this is why I freaked out.) I blasted off into hyperspace and it scared the absolute shit out of me. I tried as hard as I could to go with the flow and allow the shroom aliens to do what they wished with my brain chemicals in hyperspace, but I couldn’t stop being so terrified.\n\nIt was so fucking overwhelming. I thought about taking my benzos about a hundred times. I wanted to go back to being human, but I knew that I would regret it if I did, so I didn’t. At some points, the shroom aliens were doing strange things to my brain chemicals and showing me things in hyperspace. At other points, I was trying to die in the desert so I wouldn’t be a scared human being in hyperspace anymore. I remember trying to die in the desert and thinking “how long do I have to keep dying for?” I tried to die at least a hundred times (only a couple times were in the desert). It really felt like I was dying.\n\nThe entire trip was me trying to let go. I begged and prayed to the shroom gods to allow me to die so I could explore hyperspace without my scared human ego, but it never happened. Or at least I don’t think it did. I should have smoked weed – I think that would have gotten me there, but I was completely overwhelmed, so much that I couldn’t stand up.\n\nTime was moving incredibly slowly the entire time. I kept looking at the time and stopwatch on my phone, wondering when things would start making sense. It felt like all I had left of the human world was my ego and the time. I knew that I would return from hyperspace at the three hour mark and I was just counting down the seconds. I was also begging for the shroom aliens to just kill me and do whatever they wanted to me. I surrendered completely to them hundreds of times, but the terror just would not leave me. I was completely terrified, but I still managed to keep my mind together for the most part, and I knew the entire time that I could end it with a benzo.",[39],{"_id":40,"time":41,"description":42},"5f82a5939ebb180c1d4e750a","T1:40","Eventually, around an hour and forty minutes, I had to get up to go to the bathroom. The shroom aliens allowed me to go to the bathroom and then when I returned I decided to keep the lights on. I lay down in my bed and then start thinking about what the fuck just happened to me and I start laughing for about five minutes straight.\n\nI remember that I have a voice recorder on my phone, so I turn it on and start recording my thoughts. I’m still tripping heavily, but I’m no longer in hyperspace.",{"subject":44,"substances":44,"onset":44,"peak":44,"offset":44,"introduction":8,"description":8,"conclusion":8,"tags":44,"relatedEffects":44},true,5,[47,58,67,75,81,87,93,99],{"_id":48,"name":49,"url":50,"tags":51},"5b7b474439b82210cf57a610","Nausea","nausea",[52,53,54,55,56,57],"bodily","deliriant","miscellaneous","physical","psychedelic","uncomfortable",{"_id":59,"name":60,"url":61,"tags":62},"5b4a5cba57e0ac1a83ac633c","Anxiety","anxiety",[63,64,65,53,66,56],"amplification","cannabinoid","cognitive","enhancement",{"_id":68,"name":69,"url":70,"tags":71},"5b43d2798b36395c8633903a","Autonomous entity","autonomous-entity",[53,72,56,73,74],"hallucinatory state","sensory","visual",{"_id":76,"name":77,"url":78,"tags":79},"5b4664069b173e7348c5cb0e","Internal hallucination","internal-hallucination",[53,80,72,56,73,74],"dissociative",{"_id":82,"name":83,"url":84,"tags":85},"5b46bfc891d66d7e5521b0b0","Settings, sceneries, and landscapes","settings-sceneries-and-landscapes",[53,72,86,73,74],"hallucinogenic",{"_id":88,"name":89,"url":90,"tags":91},"5b5ba370e38ad064dc90b0c5","Delusion","delusion",[65,53,56,92],"psychological state",{"_id":94,"name":95,"url":96,"tags":97},"5b5b61e1e38ad064dc90b0c3","Time distortion","time-distortion",[65,98,56],"novel",{"_id":100,"name":101,"url":102,"tags":103},"5b81b3edf228e642f0829ce6","Laughter fits","laughter-fits",[104,54,55,56],"alteration",null,1771021849552]
