In that time, the water had become a murky greenish color, with bits of …stuff… floating in it. It had become pretty nasty but I wasn’t going to give up what amounted to maybe 5 or 6 more doses that I had paid for, having only gotten 2 experiences so far. So I emptied the bottle (there were small black flecks attached to the bottle all over the inside) and boiled the water. I then filtered the water to get the solid pieces out. It was still a murky greenish color (though it had gotten a black tint to it now). The water smelled like mildew and tasted metallic. Well fuck. I decided to put it aside in my fridge until I got the chance to test it. That chance came about a week later. I obviously hadn’t killed what dwelt in my water, as the water was now a very murky almost opaque greenish black. Wow. I decided I would test to see if anything psychedelic or redeemable still existed in there and measured out 100 mL. I measured the 4-AcO-DMT so there would be 1 mg per 2 mL. If whatever in this water was still 4-AcO-DMT (also the concentration probably got messed up through boiling it), it would’ve been a roughly 50 mg dose. Oops, very reckless.

Is it just sickness? It feels like a psychedelic come up, but it is disturbingly rapid and powerful. I begin to shake and shiver as I feel my body become lighter.

I feel as though these objects are watching me, they are responding consciously to my presence, that they are somehow reacting to me. My pillow has a very fatherly presence. My walls are huge and stoic and imposing. My desk sits quietly and gazes. My blankets are warm loving people who are wrapping around me.

Then suddenly I am as big as my bed. My bed has been molded to be my exact size, no bigger, no smaller. Suddenly my door is smaller than me, the walls trapping me inside their claustrophobic prison.
