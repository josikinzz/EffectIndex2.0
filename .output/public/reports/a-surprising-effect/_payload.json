Upon touch, it feels just about the way one would assume an oil would. It smells somewhere between a hospital disinfectant/hydrogen peroxide and a pine tree, with the balance being far tilted in the direction of the disinfectant/peroxide. Not what I expected.\n\nThere is around 15g/18ml of a-Pinene in the tiny bottle that I am using. Given that my target dose is 40mg (which was the dose that Josikinz said made her pretty high), I will draw 0.05ml of the oil with a syringe and deposit it under my tongue.\n\nPrevious experience with the compound: None. This is my first experiment with it. I have no experience with other supposedly psychoactive essential oils either.\n\nSet: A little anxiety over whether the product that we got is pure – it seems irrational, there is no reason to assume it isn’t, but stuff like this is impossible to test without professional chemical equipment, and I always get nervous when experimenting with a new substance, especially one with almost no known reports of prior human use.\n\nSetting: At home, in my room, sometimes accompanied by my youngest brother (he’s 18).\n","",[109,113,117,121,125,129],{"_id":110,"time":111,"description":112},"611a5cf4452e573c764e1c4a","22:20 (T + 00:00)","Deposited under my tongue with the syringe.

Squinting my eyes fixes this, and I specifically washed my glasses to rule out the possibility of an outside influence. Tops of the towers themselves (which are further away from me) do not seem to be as blurry. Strange. \n\tI also feel that there is some very weak cognitive suppression going on – when writing an address into my browser and generally when browsing the internet, I feel somehow blunted. This seems in line with our earlier impression that this might be a depressant (based on Josie’s experience and the fact that it supposedly somehow works on GABA).\n\tSome slight pupil constriction, especially given that I was first sitting in the dark and then in normal light, but not pronounced enough to be of note.\n",{"_id":126,"time":127,"description":128},"611a5cf4452e573c764e1c4e","22:45 (T + 00:25)","The headspace seems to have retreated a little bit (though it’s hard to tell due to how subtle it was/is). When I look at one of my paintings, the complex details of the textures seem to be baaaaaarely drifting, and, just perhaps, the whole piece (which is a geometric abstraction) appears very slightly more ‘spatial’ than normally (though it was designed to evoke a feeling of spatiality and non-flatness).",{"_id":130,"time":131,"description":132},"611a5cf4452e573c764e1c4f","22:56 (T + 00:36)","There are still hints of some headspace.

I would say that music sounds nicer now though, and I feel comfortable overall. The effect enhancing the painting seems to have increased in power, though it’s still subtle. Certain parts of the geometric structure of the painting seem to be slightly ‘popping out’ from the painting, as if it was truly a 3D shape. Definitely stronger than it was twenty minutes ago, and it made me really excited about trying this substance in higher dosages. If the effect holds, it might be a great tool for enjoying galleries even more. I tried switching the painting for a different one (also abstract geometry), to similar albeit perhaps somewhat weaker results. This almost feels like immersion enhancement for paintings, almost in a psychedelic way (but weak).",{"_id":139,"time":140,"description":141},"611a5cf4452e573c764e1c51","23:15 (T + 00:55)","I tried closing my eyes. There are no visuals, unsurprisingly, except for perhaps a super subtle ‘melting’ of the almost uniform blackness of my visual field. With my eyes closed, I feel significantly higher than with them open, and there is a hint of a body high which I would describe as comfortable and very subtle waves of warmth spreading from my chest or perhaps my neck alongside my pulse.\n\tThis reminded me to measure my heartbeat. 65 BPM, normal. Focusing on the stopwatch while counting was sort of strange, and made me unsure whether I am experiencing time flow slightly slower or faster than normal, but then I realized it’s probably just somewhat harder for me to focus properly on it. Again, an effect that one would expect from a GABA drug.\n\tHowever, this does not feel like an anxiolytic. I am always a little anxious when I am trying out new compounds, especially when there are almost no known reports on them, and this anxiety does not seem to be alleviated.\n\tMeasured my breathing rate too – 14 breaths in a minute (measured at 23:26 – T + 01:06). Somewhat elevated. Might be due to the subtle anxiety.
