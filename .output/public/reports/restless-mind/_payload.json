Visually things seem deeper too, with spaces appearing larger and objects appearing further away, or rather more detail being apparent across distances.

Everything is wobbling and bubbling, the swirling of the world around me is only serving to make me feel sicker. I eventually throw up, I probably would’ve been fine if I hadn’t eaten all that popcorn honestly. I feel so faint and faded like I am fading into my surroundings, molding into them and becoming incorporated into their surfaces which soon become overwhelmed by swells and swirls like a turbulent sea. It is very stimulating too, I am shaking a lot and feelings antsy, like there are ants crawling in my veins. Sounds echo and are resplendent, blossoming like fern fronds, it feels as though the world around me is being taken to pieces, each of which blossoms of its own accord.

My chest feels tight and light simultaneously. My heart is fluttering. I see faces and figures in the corners of my vision. It’s scary to look into reflective surfaces, as strange dark figures appear in them. Mysterious, indistinct, and indescribable auditory hallucinations come in from every direction. I have to urinate frequently. This swirling fog that has become my visuals has turned thick and all encompassing. Everything I see appears distant and like a vast landscape, the whole world is an immeasurable vista expanding out before me. Every aspect of the world around me is twisting like clockwork, intertwining and interlocking, meshing into ambiguous forms. This begins to appear as open eyed visuals-detailed and deep textures overlaid on everything, not really any clear patterns but 3-dimensional visuals. It is as if I am viewing another dimension that has become physically manifest before me in some way I can sense and comprehend. My entire field of vision is flashing various colors (red, blue, teal, green). Everything is blurry. The experience is very hard to describe and focus on, it is like it is purposely trying to elude comprehension. I am suddenly stricken by an intense inability to focus. I try to think about the experience and take notes, but I keep getting pulled away, I keep getting distracted and drawn off without even noticing that I have been led astray. It feels like I am swimming against the current, or trying to dive down with a floatation device attached. This isn’t the intense scatterbrained focus that comes with being stoned or other psychedelics. This is just raw and shallow distraction, I can’t engage with anything or learn anything or effectively do anything. Sometimes, with certain substances, I can harness my distractability to really sink into various tasks and take in a wide range of information. This just feels flat and pallid.\n",{"_id":63,"time":64,"description":65},"5d09620de573c21b63a2a88c","T3:00","I go outside. It is magical, the sky is beautiful and rippling with colors and patterns.

Go to bed.","5-MeO-tryptamines are fuckin weird. Ask most people and they’ll tell you that they are not very visual but mentally very deep. This is true, and that’s a very vague description. In my experience, no group of drugs has been able to defy descriptions more than these weird tryptamines, to the point where they are divorced from the rest of the tryptamine family and could be considered a class of drugs of their own. This one in particular filled me with a crushing inability to focus. What a weird drug. I’m not sure if the experience was enjoyable and there was a bit of bodyload. Probably won’t repeat the experience, there isn’t much value to me except as a novelty.
