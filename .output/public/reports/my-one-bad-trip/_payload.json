After a little while I became very aware of my throat; I could feel my windpipe and all my veins, and I was not getting a satisfactory amount of air as I was lying down with my head quite high up (on some pillows). When I moved my head it felt like all the tubes in my throat were getting tangled and folded, so I went into the living room to sit upright. I was lost in thought, and somehow came to the realisation that I was dying; I had just ingested a research chemical, made by people I’ve never known about in a lab somewhere I’ve never seen, and I was convinced that I had taken one risk too many by ingesting these chemicals. I started to get worried, and told my girlfriend I was dying (she tried reassuring me), and tried to call my friend to warn him not to take any more, blah blah. I didn’t die and I felt like a drama queen afterwards.\n\nThe rest of the trip, despite thinking I was about to die, was nice and reassuring; in the end, it took away my fear of death. At the time I was dwelling on the things I’d never achieved in my life, but since then I’ve quit the job I hated, went travelling, and made my life a bit better overall. When I was tripping I was convinced that I was going to become a part of the universe; I would live on forever as an integral part of space and time, as part of the background radiation of the universe or as a part of its static.\n\nI was listening to some classical Indian music, one with some chanting in it, and the song morphed into a goatrance song (though not in reality), and I clearly heard a gruff man’s voice say “We. Are. One.” This was it. I said my goodbyes to my girlfriend, closed my eyes, and fell forward onto the bed I was sitting on, and the visuals changed from magnificent colors and gently became grey and cloud-like; like a mix of grey clouds and TV static, when the TV is between channels. I thought this was the cosmic radiation I was meant to be part of, but I think it was just intense ego death as I don’t remember any more of it, and I was sober after.",[35],{"_id":36,"time":28,"description":37},"5f7bacf1a20327060b73098b","After the trip I was dopey for about 90 minutes. We watched American Dad and I just didn’t know when I was meant to laugh, so I just faked some laughter whenever I heard my girlfriend laugh. I couldn’t even choose between 2 episodes as I literally couldn’t make the decision; I had no thinking power at all, and it felt horrible.",{"subject":39,"substances":39,"onset":39,"peak":39,"offset":39,"introduction":8,"description":8,"conclusion":8,"tags":39,"relatedEffects":39},true,3,[42,53,61,68,75,81],{"_id":43,"name":44,"url":45,"tags":46},"5b7b474439b82210cf57a610","Nausea","nausea",[47,48,49,50,51,52],"bodily","deliriant","miscellaneous","physical","psychedelic","uncomfortable",{"_id":54,"name":55,"url":56,"tags":57},"5b47acf0a1f46901e3750671","Geometry","geometry",[58,56,51,59,60],"geometric","sensory","visual",{"_id":62,"name":63,"url":64,"tags":65},"5b5ba370e38ad064dc90b0c5","Delusion","delusion",[66,48,51,67],"cognitive","psychological state",{"_id":69,"name":70,"url":71,"tags":72},"5b49a6eaea24120b49b24b56","Tactile hallucination","tactile-hallucination",[48,73,59,74],"hallucinatory state","tactile",{"_id":76,"name":77,"url":78,"tags":79},"5b49a59cea24120b49b24b54","Auditory hallucination","auditory-hallucination",[80,48,73,49,51,59],"auditory",{"_id":82,"name":83,"url":84,"tags":85},"5fb2d59784bcbf393b0c3839","Ego death","ego-death",[66,86,51,87],"dissociative","transpersonal state",null,1771021849653]
