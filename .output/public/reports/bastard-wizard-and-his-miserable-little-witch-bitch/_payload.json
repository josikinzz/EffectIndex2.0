Instead, there was a grey fuzziness and nothing was distinct.\n\nI felt iron fingers all over my body, and when I closed my eyes and sat back the fingers gripped me and were dragging me in an arch out of this world and into the Other. I felt like I was moving backwards and sideways, with the final destination (back inside my body) in sight. This way, I could visualise how long the salvia was going to last. But I was also worried about going backwards too far, in case I didn’t come back...\n\nWhen I was in the Otherworld, I could see a witch and wizard (I smoked the salvia through a wizard-shaped bong), made out of the grey, fuzzy, non-descript visuals (think TV static). There could have been more of them but I can’t be sure.\n\nThey were telling me, in sinister voices, “You will die. You will ruin everything and take your friends with you.” I was frightened, and could imagine the police coming and arresting us all, and it all being my fault (though I knew that salvia is legal in the UK). I prematurely ended the trip by opening my eyes, standing up, and walking away from the bong. That was it, nothing more, though it did set The Fear in me which stayed for the beginning of my ayahuasca trip later that day.",null,1771021849353]
