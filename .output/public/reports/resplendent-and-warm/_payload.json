I feel like there are presences around me. I keep getting this feeling that there is a distinct presence hovering directly in front of my face, receding and pouncing in rythic motion. My eyes twitch and flinch at this constant stimulus. It feels like my visual perspective keeps getting shifted back and forth violently between my perception and a 3rd person perception, completely at random and beyond my control.
