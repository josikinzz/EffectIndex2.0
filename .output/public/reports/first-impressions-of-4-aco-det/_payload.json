My friend and I played video games most of the time, starting with Tetris Attack on the SNES while we waited for the drug to come up.\n\nThis drug was very similar to shrooms and LSD. It first started adopting shroom-like qualities and at the peak turned more into an LSD feeling. I was genuinely surprised with how good the body high felt. I never once felt too uncomfortable, minus a few times where I was getting too warm or too cold. We specifically took a threshold dose the first time to dip our toes in, but we plan on revisiting this drug in the coming weeks at progressively higher doses. I greatly enjoyed the entire experience at this level and can recommend it to anyone that wants a trip similar to shrooms or LSD but doesn't want to commit more than 4-5 hours to it.","",[27,31,35,39,43,47],{"_id":28,"time":29,"description":30},"5f8a7bb6e2e8c837930fb823","4:28pm","I dosed 25mg orally in a gel capsule with my friend.",{"_id":32,"time":33,"description":34},"5f8a7bb6e2e8c837930fb824","4:53pm","I'm feeling dissociated and getting mild focus suppression.
