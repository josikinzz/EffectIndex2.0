As has previously happened in other trips, I had many suppressed memories and buried trauma that began to surface and as per usual I put it away. I listened to my friend X who kept chatting on and letting me just listen, I listened to the music as everything glowed and glimmered and shimmered around me. Everything was waving slightly and swirling with the most beautiful colors imaginable.\n\nAs I listened to my friend talk, we talked about varies issues I was struggling with while not going too deep. I had asked before hand to have a fun light trip and that it's okay to keep moving on. We did this, and it felt in the background the mushrooms began solving my issues and telling me what I need to work on. I realized what I needed to do and what my current apparent issues are.","64fdc4ddab78aebb7f786f63",{"time":43,"description":44,"_id":45},"later note","my friend grounding me massively impacted me and made it much easier not to stress and just enjoy the trip.

Everything had a rainbow glow to it, the text on my phone shined as a prism, everything was light colored, almost pastel in a way. I journaled the different things that were brought into my mind during the trip. Unlike acid, shrooms did not bring me the usual light anxiety of different things I needed to solve right there. Usually during acid I can push the aside and have a fun time, but with these shrooms, I didn't need to. The shrooms understood and let me enjoy and relax.","64fdc4ddab78aebb7f786f64",{"time":52,"description":53,"_id":54},"3:45am-4:30am","I was having difficulty sleeping and took multiple sleeping meds. I had decided that going to sleep was more important than being left in my own head and ruining any afterglow. I felt good, with a nice afterglow with pretty colors. I felt it was unfortunate that I didn't feel a massive anti depressant effect that I normally feel from shrooms (and as of multiple days later this still is the case). But, it was still good for it to help me discover what I needed to deal with and as always, the shrooms were as loving as ever.","64fdc4ddab78aebb7f786f65","I'm glad I tripped and I feel it help me discover something inside myself that I haven't accepted before. I have always felt some sort of queerness deep down, and the shrooms made me realize that it was just my trauma in the past that was blocking it.
