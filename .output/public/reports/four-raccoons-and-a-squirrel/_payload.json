It felt as if my knife skills had been completely honed, and I was just really in tune with the music was I was listening to (mostly modern rock, neo-psychedelic and indie pop). \n\nThe \"tip-off\" for the fact I was coming up, apart from the stimulation and greatly enhanced hand control, was walking almost like I would on DXM.

This effect was extremely enhanced, and I really loved hearing all the individual parts of music, and the small background details that I had entirely missed before the first dozen times I'd listened to my playlist. \n\nReopening my eyes just caused the geometry and tessellation to be even stronger, almost blending what was reality and what I was actually looking at.

A few minutes later a squirrel also came up to me, and I decided to go inside at this point.
