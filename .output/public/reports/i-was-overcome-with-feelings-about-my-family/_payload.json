I believe this had to be due to my high tolerance. I had tripped frequently this week. My trip was still very powerful, however, as I was overcome with feelings.\n\nI was overcome with happiness for my mother. I was so happy that she found her boyfriend. I was so happy that she had someone to hug, talk to, cuddle with, and have sex with now that my father is dead. I was so happy that she didn’t have to be alone anymore. I was also overcome with sadness for what she lost with my father. I realized that I hadn’t cried over my father’s death and I finally just cried. I felt so terrible for my mother. I felt so bad that she had lost her husband.\n\nI cried for three hours straight. Sometimes I just screamed out from the tears and sometimes I collapsed onto the floor. The crying was not bad at all. It was beautiful. I needed to get out of the negative emotions out of my body and this was the way to do it. I cried and I felt negative emotions strongly, but I was not experiencing a bad trip.\n\nI also felt incredibly sad that my brother hasn't found a girlfriend and does not have a relationship of his own. I wanted him to be happy, like I am. I texted my brother to tell him that I loved him and that I wanted a better relationship with him.\n\nMy boyfriend came over while I was coming down and we had a wonderful time together. My boyfriend and the 4-aco-dmt helped me realize that the relationship that you have with your family is very important.",null,1771021849577]
