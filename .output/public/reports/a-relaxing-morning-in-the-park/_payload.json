I thought I would start off by watching some pornography, but it looked so fake that I lost all interest in it. I was listening to some music as well, and the actors’ gyrations synched up with the music, and their bodies were covered in visuals, but there was nothing arousing about what I saw so I headed out for a walk in the sun.",[27],{"_id":28,"time":24,"description":29},"5f7bc1b1a20327060b730994","I took a more scenic route, and stopped every now and then to smell the flowers, which isn’t something I had done before but I shall definitely try to remember to smell more things when I next trip. I’m pretty sure that they smelled more intensely than normal, more clearly defined. I could smell individual flowers from a bunch all at the same time. I found a quiet spot in the sun when I was in the park proper, and meditated. I thought about myself from the view of an outsider, and analysed some of the things I had said to some friends in the last week, and I was remedying myself; I ought to be a more considerate friend, I ought to make more time for the people I don’t see very often, things like that. The visuals weren’t all-encompassing, but they were a nice touch to what was a more psychologically cleansing trip. There were no cosmic mysteries, no aliens, no ancient religion, it was all down-to-earth and concerned with normal activities and how to improve myself. It kept my ego in check, as opposed to stripping it away, and the good vibes carried on for a few more weeks after; I made the time to see my seldom-seen friends, and was more reassuring to one or two who were having family troubles at the time.",[],{"subject":32,"substances":32,"onset":32,"peak":32,"offset":8,"introduction":8,"description":8,"conclusion":8,"tags":32,"relatedEffects":32},true,3,[35,45,53,58],{"_id":36,"name":37,"url":38,"tags":39},"5b49b508c96f861899269049","Olfactory enhancement","olfactory-enhancement",[40,41,42,43,44],"enhancement","olfactory","psychedelic","sensory","smell and taste",{"_id":46,"name":47,"url":48,"tags":49},"5b60d774f8650203ba48b050","Introspection","introspection",[50,51,42,52],"cognitive","dissociative","psychological state",{"_id":54,"name":55,"url":56,"tags":57},"5b60ed2af8650203ba48b057","Rejuvenation","rejuvenation",[50,42,52],{"_id":59,"name":60,"url":61,"tags":62},"5b55453a4227356db8086618","Personal bias suppression","personal-bias-suppression",[50,42,63],"suppression",null,1771021849231]
