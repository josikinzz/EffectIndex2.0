It was not terrible nor was it too upsetting, but it was a great reminder for me about proper set and setting. I should not have tripped that day. First of all, I had already tripped. I had a great trip a couple days ago, and I should have waited. I was having trouble with my boyfriend. He wasn't responding to his phone (he was in another city) and I was scared that he didn’t like me anymore and was going to break up with me.\n\nSo with all this on my mind, I still decided to trip. I went outside, but all I could fucking think about was my relationship problems. I didn’t know what to do. I decided I’d have to go inside because I couldn’t take it outside. I went inside, but I felt weird. I didn’t feel good… I just felt alien. I felt like a robot… It was so strange being human, at the time. I tried everything I could to stop the bad trip. I didn't have any visuals.\n\nI tried singing and dancing. It was not a terrible trip, but I felt afterwards, that it had exposed me to my darkest places… My fears… I have so much to deal with. I decided to drink. I felt good for a while but the feeling left me and my boyfriend finally called me. He broke up with me over the phone. I cried and had a panic attack. It was terrible. He was drunk and sorry that he had broken up with me while I was having a bad trip.\n\nI took opiates and drank the rest of my alcohol. I cried so fucking much. And for a few days after that, there was no happiness. I needed time to heal. I felt like all of my faults had been unleashed to me.\n\nI decided to stop tripping for awhile until I got caught up with my problems and fixed some things in my life.",null,1771021849737]
