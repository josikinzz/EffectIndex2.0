At one point I look at my hand and imagine myself growing old and dying. When I close my eyes there is very faint level two geoemtry with an array of everchanging imagery pertaining to retro 16bit videogames. I have been playing a lot of classic nintendo games recently so my hallucinations are presumably playing off of that. At one point I see giant 16bit pincers eating a neon ball that was bouncing off of some walls.

I'm getting very strong acuity enhancement, colour enhancement, level 5 geometry, and drifting. I attempt to categorise the style variations of the geometry to definitvely document their style. While I'm doing this my friend does the same thing with her's as she has taken the same dosage. I am incredibly confused while reading and trying to understand my own writings.Throughout this process I was laughing intensely at the situation, as it seemed absurd that I had ingested this drug and was trying to categorise it's effects in such a seemingly pedantic level of detail, instead of just lying back and enjoying myself like a normal person.\n\nI now realise that I need to seriously rework this section of the subjective effect index. Regardless though, the categories it fit into are: \n\nIntricate in complexity, abstract in style, synthetic in theme, unstructured in form, brightly lit in lighting, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, equally soft and sharp in its edges, small in size, fast in motion, jittery in framerate, non immersive, and consistent in intensity. \n\nWhen we compare notes afterwards the only difference was that she categorised her's as slow in motion, and I categorised mine as fast. I find it interesting that both of our categorisations lined up so closely.

It's hard for me to comment on whether or not this is even still the drug in action as I find that whenever I trip, I experience faint visual effects until I fall asleep. Even if I stay up 24 hours after the initial dose. I suspect hppd has something to do with this.","Nothing particularly remarkable happened during this trip, but I have found 4-AcO-DET to be one of my favourite tryptamines so far.
