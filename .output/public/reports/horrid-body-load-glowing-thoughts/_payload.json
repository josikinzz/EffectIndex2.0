Feeling colder. Energy courses through my muscles, I need to stand up and pace my room to let it out. My guts begin to rumble and roll as the stomach discomfort and nausea starts to set in. Nothing can prepare me for how this is about to go. Mentally I am feeling very high. It's been a shit week so I can't say it's brought me to feeling euphoric, but I don't feel completely shitty which is nice. I guess I feel hopeful for how this trip will go. Visuals picking up in the form of breathing and fractal patterns on my ceiling.

I feel utterly nauseated with a piercing ache in my abdomen. It feels like tiny insects made of razorblades are pulsing through my muscles. I feel frigid. I am shivering violently while also experiencing intense tremors. No position I can put my body in feels remotely comfortable. The mere concept of being in the same position for more than 30 seconds is horrific to imagine. I must constantly be in motion, I must constantly be letting off all the explosive energy pent up inside me, electrocuting my muscles like a supercell storm and stimulating me beyond any imaginable level of comfort.\nI am pacing the room, plopping myself onto my bed, getting up, sitting by my computer,  getting up again, cycling and cycling. All I can think is \"what did I do to my body\". The visuals grow ever stronger, with the world around me shaking and leaving rainbow tracers. Everything is vibrating and giving off forcefields of color. Any surface with a pattern begins to mirror itself and reflect upon itself.",[43,47,51,55],{"_id":44,"time":45,"description":46},"5cc16ae97caf856be584f840","T2:30","The sheer power of this trip has fortunately managed to overwhelm the heavy heavy body load. I finally manage to lie still, curled up under blankets. Every sound around me is an echoing psychedelic mess. I close my eyes under my covers and my world explodes with 3 dimensional closed eye visuals. I can feel my body liquefy and fall away as my mind drifts off. My thoughts race and unfold like fern fronds, gracefully spiralling and dancing away into oblivion. One thought leads to another, and another, and they all beautifully bloom into the next one. Suddenly I realize that I have drifted off. The entire flowing structure of thought processes collapses as I jerk myself back into reality. I open my eyes. The ceiling is an abyss of swirling fractals and forms and faces made of dancing and swirling fractals. Every object in the room loses its defined edges as I stand up. Every boundary of my vision is spiraling away into infinity. I sit down at the computer and slowly regain lucidity.",{"_id":48,"time":49,"description":50},"5cc16ae97caf856be584f83f","T2:45","I get back on my bed. I fade into psychedelic oblivion again. My blanket becomes a grand warm bear that cuddles me and curls up around me to calm my frigid shaking. I feel safe, but its a strange kind of comfort, like I am being safely kept in dangerous hands. Something volatile has decided to be merciful to me. As I drift away from the corporeal world into darkness, I am addressed by a booming voice, from what I can deduce it is the voice of this grand bear of my mind. \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING\". What followed was a conversation between my nervous awkward self and some sort of figure of grand authority and overbearing power. My timidity, self loathing, and awkwardness were put on trial in great contrast to the authoritative confidence and self assuredness of this booming voice. Sadly, I cannot remember much of the conversation. I wish I wrote down what I had been told, perhaps it could've been useful to me.",{"_id":52,"time":53,"description":54},"5cc16ae97caf856be584f83e","T3:00","I snap myself back into reality. I am still cold, still shaking, still very uncomfortable. But I feel comfort and warmth in the power of this trip and the swirling chaotic fractal world around me. I fade in and out of lucidity and corporeality a few more times, but these times I just disappear from the world and sit alone in an abyss, alone with surreal psychedelic trivial thoughts. Interestingly, I didn't feel my strange ascension over social interaction this trip. Usually, socializing is rendered impossible because I become mortally afraid of the sheer triviality of every interaction-everything just seems too ridiculous to do or interact with. But this time I feel fully immersed in the world, on the same humble level of everything.\n",{"_id":56,"time":57,"description":54},"5cc16ae97caf856be584f83d","T3:30",[59,63,67],{"_id":60,"time":61,"description":62},"5cc16ae97caf856be584f843","T5:00","The movie is still going when my roommate and friends come back.
