I have yet to try the 3-MeO-PCE and 3-Me-PCPy I have sitting around, but I anticipate that this one is much more sedating than the two. I'm excited to revisit this substance in the future, probably at a higher dose or combined with a tryptamine, though I could see this dose being very lovely for social settings.","6117fbcdbb4f7a63021143b2","lucid-and-comfortable-sedation",3,{"subject":107,"substances":60,"onset":60,"peak":60,"offset":60,"introduction":60,"conclusion":60,"tags":107,"relatedEffects":60},true,1771021849613]
