In the shower I try to sit down and curl up and do whatever it is I can to ease this unnerving discomfort. The water feels like its clattering on me, my body flatly refusing to take in any of its warmth and life. I sit down and a feeling begins to come over me, like some dark force has begun burning in my stomach and is seeping into my veins. I stare at the wall as the droplets on it begin to flow and drift. They begin to merge and form into vague biomorphic shapes, the drops seeming to be part of some hivemind or collective consciousness. Each drop seems like an ant creeping up and down the shower. As the wall behind them begins to swirl with color my face contorts into a twisted grin. I have such a warm feeling of satisfaction from watching these droplets march down the wall, yet there is such a sinister feeling, as if my perception is at the mercy of nature. I am aware of how cruel nature can be, but there is pleasure in knowing that it is being merciful right now.
