I start riding my bike towards a local park and notice that the world seems even more beautiful than usual. Once I stop to rest and sit on a bench I start feeling very nauseous. My body-high is now pretty distinct, there are very subtle colors on the back of my eyelids, and I'm noticing patterns and textures more than usual.

I begin noticing countless \"little\" things such as homeless people, the smell of fried chicken, air pollution, society, and technology. The acknowledgement of these things which I would usually ignore results in an intense state of pondering and analysis.

I spent what felt like hours lost in geometry and highly vivid daydreams or low-level internal hallucinations. I spent a lot of time being forced to analyze my relationship with my ex, the death of my father, my urge to reproduce, my new job, and my current relationships with my girlfriend's. There was a surprising lack of cosmic or spiritual thoughts which I usually get on psychedelics, but instead my brain focused more on my life in general and it's interpersonal relationships.

I can't stop getting lost in highly vivid daydreams, most of which are not particularly exciting memory replays such as revisiting the date I had with that guy the other night as if I were actually there. Snuggling my girlfriend is highly arousing, my whole body feels euphoric and I get extremely turned on but I'm far too sedated to have sex and cannot begin to focus.

I felt as if my brain had been defragged and that I could appreciate my life to a greater extent.","Although this trip wasn't particularly intense or profound, I am posting it regardless as part of my effort to document all future psychedelic experiences in a manner which could later yield useful information for my substance effect documentation project.\n\nThis was my first trip in over 6 months and proved to be excellent practice for utilizing the standardized documentation methodology which was outlined in my previous blog post. My next trip will be the coming Friday. I am going to take a heavy dosage of 2C-E (30mg) and it will likely yield far more interesting results.\n\nThanks for reading.",{"subject":82,"substances":82,"onset":82,"peak":82,"offset":82,"introduction":83,"description":83,"conclusion":82,"tags":82,"relatedEffects":82},true,false,4,[86,95,103,111,117,123,128,134,141,147,152],{"_id":87,"name":88,"url":89,"tags":90},"5b49a89bea24120b49b24b58","Spontaneous tactile sensations","spontaneous-tactile-sensations",[91,92,93,94],"miscellaneous","psychedelic","sensory","tactile",{"_id":96,"name":97,"url":98,"tags":99},"5b75cde36b7b4d388828c645","Stimulation","stimulation",[100,101,91,102],"amplification","enhancement","physical",{"_id":104,"name":105,"url":106,"tags":107},"5b60d774f8650203ba48b050","Introspection","introspection",[108,109,92,110],"cognitive","dissociative","psychological state",{"_id":112,"name":113,"url":114,"tags":115},"5b218d716d91db1503c9e969","Increased pareidolia","increased-pareidolia",[100,101,92,93,116],"visual",{"_id":118,"name":119,"url":120,"tags":121},"5b55453a4227356db8086618","Personal bias suppression","personal-bias-suppression",[108,92,122],"suppression",{"_id":124,"name":125,"url":126,"tags":127},"5b4a59dd57e0ac1a83ac633b","Analysis enhancement","analysis-enhancement",[100,108,101,92],{"_id":129,"name":130,"url":131,"tags":132},"5b47acf0a1f46901e3750671","Geometry","geometry",[133,131,92,93,116],"geometric",{"_id":135,"name":136,"url":137,"tags":138},"5b4a95c357e0ac1a83ac6346","Increased sense of humor","increased-sense-of-humor",[100,139,108,101,92,140],"cannabinoid","stimulant",{"_id":142,"name":143,"url":144,"tags":145},"5b81a6a8d9922e7c6f7353d0","Sedation","sedation",[146,102,122],"deliriant",{"_id":148,"name":149,"url":150,"tags":151},"5b4a5cba57e0ac1a83ac633c","Anxiety","anxiety",[100,139,108,146,101,92],{"_id":153,"name":154,"url":155,"tags":156},"5b394f3a7323db68ca54d23a","Recursion","recursion",[157,92,93,116],"distortion",{"_id":159,"bio_parsed":160,"tags":161,"not_public":82,"full_name":162,"alias":163,"email":164,"social_media":165,"bio":178,"gravatar_hash":183,"__v":184,"profile_url":185,"featured":82,"role":186,"profile_image":187},"60542430198361300fea3610",[],[],"Josie Kins","Josikinz","disregardeverythingisay@gmail.com",[166,170,174],{"type":167,"_id":168,"value":169},"reddit","60570f8534555a5df506dc55","https://reddit.com/u/josikins",{"type":171,"_id":172,"value":173},"twitter","60570f8534555a5df506dc56","https://twitter.com/josikinz",{"type":175,"_id":176,"value":177},"personal","61199fe868a28c38c14d411b","",{"_id":179,"length":180,"parsed":181,"raw":182},"64d05b22bc700c6d164d5fc9",472,"[{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Hey there, my name is Josie Kins.
