I have decided to explore the woods near my spot and have discovered an incredible place. The forest is littered with fire pits and encampments, and part of it has a large stone wall on a cliff with windows and stairs down to the park below. It’s like a castle! There is a large boulder that I can climb and sun myself on too, and its really cool because a really busy road cuts through the boulder with a tunnel. Ascending this wooded hill, I reach the summit, a large open space with logs to sit on and a large peace sign made of vines and painted and tied to a tree. All of this seems like ritual spaces, but from what I’ve heard hippies just gather there and do drum circles once a week.\n",{"_id":38,"time":39,"description":40},"5cc12c1f7caf856be584f81b","T1:00","-I run around the forest because I am suddenly so stimulated and full of energy. If I stop moving my legs feel twitchy and itchy and restless. Some nausea is setting in, but I took many measures against it (This being monitoring my diet for the past 24 hours, taking a trace mineral preload, drinking ginger ale and taking ginger extract supplements, immodium, tums, and pepto bismal tablets). I perhaps would be in more pain had I not, and maybe even vomited.  I manage to sit down and smoke a bowl on the summit of the hill however. The weed feels nice, it feels like it leeches into my body and numbs the nausea and restlessness. I lie down and stare at the sky and listen to music. The patterns that form from the clouds are large and colorful and not very intricate. I close my eyes and the CEV’s are also somewhat faint, but much more intricately patterned.",[42,46,50,54,58,62],{"_id":43,"time":44,"description":45},"5cc12c1f7caf856be584f824","T1:15","-Open eyed visuals becoming more apparent.

I feel very focused, it is the sorted boosted mental aptitude I feel when I am on acid. I also feel like I have superior proprioception. I see now why people often sell this 2C as “An LSD-like experience”. It feels very similar, although more stimulating, and the visuals have a different nature. They seem more synthetic, with less pareidolia or organically blossoming/flowing shapes and patterns. To reach the trail that I want to walk on, I have to climb down that boulder.

I am outside though, I have access to the great sky and beautiful plants and fresh air all around me, everything is seen through a fisheye lens with distortions on the periphery and everything is colorful and beautiful. A friend invited me to a party later that night and I decide whether or not I’m going to go. I branch off the trail to a cool smoke spot overlooking the river. While there I see a goose. I end up staring at it for a good 15 minutes, just utterly fascinated by this living breathing animal in front of me. The way it preens its feathers, the way it bent its neck and moved its head as if trying to communicate with me, the expression on its face, it was all so fascinating.",{"_id":55,"time":56,"description":57},"5cc12c1f7caf856be584f821","T2:50","The sun is setting.

I quickly shelter with their housemate because she definitely understands what sorta experience I’m having. I am able to anchor myself and get comfortable.

I would say I’m back to baseline now.","2C-I has been sold under the line “It’s a lot like acid” and I can see why. In terms of headspace and physical effects, it is very similar, although it is more stimulating, and although similar the body high leans more towards other 2Cs. The visuals are also more like the other 2C’s, being very synthetic. For me, LSD’s visuals are a coalescence of organic and synthetic, while this was more purely synthetic. At this dose I was also fairly lucid the entire time, I could operate my phone. The visuals were a great deal of fun though. Also euphoria presented. Hard to tell if that was from set/setting because this is my only time taking it, although I have a hunch that this drug has a great euphoric aspect, also contributing to it being sold as something similar to MDMA too. Overall I would say this drug is great, I want to test it to see how much bodyload it creates without my precautions, and if it is benign enough with respect to that and with respect to headspace at higher doses, it might make its way into my toolkit for making combinations, likely for situations requiring stimulation and heightened physical control.",{"subject":81,"substances":81,"onset":81,"peak":81,"offset":81,"introduction":81,"description":9,"conclusion":81,"tags":81,"relatedEffects":81},true,2,[84,93,101,107,115,121,126,131],{"_id":85,"name":86,"url":87,"tags":88},"5b75cde36b7b4d388828c645","Stimulation","stimulation",[89,90,91,92],"amplification","enhancement","miscellaneous","physical",{"_id":94,"name":95,"url":96,"tags":97},"5b198863e60c9e06f06ddcf6","Colour enhancement","colour-enhancement",[89,90,98,99,100],"psychedelic","sensory","visual",{"_id":102,"name":103,"url":104,"tags":105},"5b47acf0a1f46901e3750671","Geometry","geometry",[106,104,98,99,100],"geometric",{"_id":108,"name":109,"url":110,"tags":111},"5b7b474439b82210cf57a610","Nausea","nausea",[112,113,91,92,98,114],"bodily","deliriant","uncomfortable",{"_id":116,"name":117,"url":118,"tags":119},"5b429377384b4958dbcd1a51","Symmetrical texture repetition","symmetrical-texture-repetition",[120,98,99,100],"distortion",{"_id":122,"name":123,"url":124,"tags":125},"5b2839b3809a7131085cf527","Drifting","drifting",[120,98,99,100],{"_id":127,"name":128,"url":129,"tags":130},"5b7095186a045869c5d09a87","Bodily control enhancement","bodily-control-enhancement",[89,90,91,92,98],{"_id":132,"name":133,"url":134,"tags":135},"5b4a986c57e0ac1a83ac634a","Novelty enhancement","novelty-enhancement",[89,136,137,90,138,98],"cannabinoid","cognitive","entactogen",null,1771021849316]
