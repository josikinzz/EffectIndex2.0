When I took this dose I had recently accidentally overdosed on 200mg of DMT in an ayahuasca brew, which was a pretty traumatic experience. I am very stressed about many different aspects in my life (my health, financial security, family health, work stuff, etc) and having minor PTSD flashbacks to the ayahuasca experience.
