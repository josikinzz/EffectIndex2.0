As recreational drug users, we must stand unilaterally against the drug war, we must recognize how it is unevenly leveraged to systematically oppress people of color, especially black people. We must stand in solidarity with those who share with us the universal desire to alter their minds, which should be a human right, as they face repression from brutal police and laws with no basis in objective reality. Whether we like it or not we are participants in the deeply unjust drug war, as we must stand with those who are most vulnerable.\n\nJoin the ongoing protests, donate to local bail or supply funds, check your racist friends, and begin opening realistic dialogue towards opposing the drug war as another insidious arm of white supremacy and the militarized police state. Think about how unnecessary police and their violence would be with a total upheaval of American drug policy. All conversations on police abolition (or even reform I guess) should prominently feature an undoing of the American Drug War and clemency for its victims. That black lives matter should go without saying.",[26,30,34,38,42,46,50,54],{"_id":27,"time":28,"description":29},"5f908e954e97330a29a67d2a","T0:00","one and a half tabs placed on my tongue.",{"_id":31,"time":32,"description":33},"5f908e954e97330a29a67d2b","T0:22","First notes possibly, a feeling of weight yet lightness simultaneously, while a tingling stimulation climbs my nerves.",{"_id":35,"time":36,"description":37},"5f908e954e97330a29a67d2c","T0:30","Begin to feel more physical effects- clenching jaw and a slight twisting discomfort in my muscles.

There is a distinct sense of continuing acceleration as my mind begins to trail off deeper into the hyper-analytical hyper-sensitive state of psychedelia. My thoughts begin to flow freely into one another with the energy of an iridescent avalanche, its fringes trailing off into gaseous fractals. I gaze at my ceiling, where great harmonic forms bind and twist into each other, flowing with stripes and ripples and constantly reforming at a consistent calculated pace.\n\nI find myself intimately retracing pleasant memories. I fall deep into introspective holes, adorned with pillars of flowing color around their fringes like a grand temple to my memories.

I want to follow the events of what is turning into a major uprising after the first round of riots last night. I want to witness history in real time. I tune into a livestream where protesters have surrounded the 3rd Police Precinct during the daytime. Police and the crowd steadily grow more and more aggressive.

I’ve noticed lately that I rarely get intense visuals from psychedelics anymore, but within this experience they are vivid and apparent. Waves of nausea bubble up occasionally but it is for the most part manageable, moreso than other lysergamides in my experience.\n\nI am tracking events now via a police scanner, an aerial live stream, and a livestream on the ground. The people have now raided a nearby Target and are expropriating goods en masse. The police on the scanner sound increasingly distressed as they are assailed by the furious crowd, raining projectiles on them. The people have now gained the initiative in this battle, the police are now defending what they can on their back foot. It is exhilarating to witness history in real time from a bunch of different perspectives. I revel in my ability to do this. My headspace is lucid and coherent, I can process thoughts clearly and rapidly without getting bogged down in loops or holes.

Its wings and body ripple above me, blended seamlessly into the textures of my ceiling, perpetually self-transforming into yet more intricate and ornate designs.

Such aesthetic, beautiful, and well-composed designs.\n\nI am ravenously taking in information, reading firsthand account after firsthand account about what’s happening on the ground in Minneapolis, watching it happen live, all the various methods of input are glistening ornate ribbons streaming into my head to be processed by this this gaudy ostentatious gilded psychedelic machine that chews them up and turns them into iridescent jets of rippling crackling energy that surges through my neurons.

Highlight videos of the day’s events have begun to pop up on social media, becoming memes and viral points of humor. Despite the tragedy at the heart of this uprising the people seem joyous in their rage. The first building of the night has gone up in flames, soon to be followed by many more. The fires on the computer screen flare with rainbow colors. All I can do is watch and smile dumbfounded, the burning overclocking machine of before has slowed down a bit and I feel like I am taking in and processing information at a more normal rate.\n\n\nThe visuals continue to be vivid- now they weave and intertwine with each other and blossom into ornate florets reminiscent of meso-American stone reliefs, adorning every mottled and rough surface. They are apparent and prominent, though they don’t aggressively seize my attention, rather if I give them a second to blossom they will happily do so.

Visuals chase me and trace around me as I walk, and per usual catch up with me when I stop moving, pulsing and breathing as they seep in. I encounter few other people, but I avoid them, I feel awkward and ungainly. Despite changing my surroundings my thoughts are obsessively fixated on the tension that seems to have finally broken in this country, on how unrest has begun to spring up in other cities on just the second night, on the ripples that will be felt across the nation, of how this city I’m in now and the empty streets I was walking now could very well soon be the scene of a similar uprising (and indeed, just a few days later, it was).

I heat up some food.\n\nI tune back into the stream to see an absolutely awe inspiring scene- an under construction condominium has gone up in flames, it is fully consumed by fire, a 6 story building engulfed in soaring pillars of flame, the fire is immense and furious, it is the largest building fire I have ever witnessed. The people on the street must retreat from it because the heat output is so great, the sound of it crackling and roaring overwhelms everything as it belches illuminated smoke into the sky. It must be visible for miles around, it is a towering flaming beacon calling to everyone across the country to rise up against police repression. And indeed, in the following week, uprisings, riots, protests, and mass unrest flared up in almost every single city in America, in every single state. My jaw is agape at the size and power of this fire, of how it illuminates everything, of the sheer destructive force as the building begins to collapse, of how the unrest of just a few has produced an object of such incredible force and such undeniable power.

Most notable about this compound was that it was extremely visual relative to other lysergamides while remaining very lucid and coherent. There was little body load or overwhelming stimulation. The peak was intense and fairly short with a long pleasant afterglow that was still replete with delightful and ornate visuals. There wasn’t the same degree of cognitive depth or mental intensity that LSD brings about- it was certainly shallower and less introspective. This is a drug ideal for enhancing other real life experiences, such as walking around or going to concerts (whenever that’s safe again) or visiting beautiful places. Socializing was still awkward but became much more manageable during the steady functional comedown. It was at once fairly intense, yet entirely manageable. This is ideal as a beginners psychedelic for people who are just delving into the wide variety of what research chemicals have to offer.",{"subject":102,"substances":102,"onset":102,"peak":102,"offset":102,"introduction":102,"description":8,"conclusion":102,"tags":102,"relatedEffects":102},true,4,[105,113,121,126,131,139,149,156,162,167,172,179,185],{"_id":106,"name":107,"url":108,"tags":109},"5b85a4c0fc5e853400adc52d","Teeth grinding","teeth-grinding",[110,111,112],"bodily","physical","uncomfortable",{"_id":114,"name":115,"url":116,"tags":117},"5b7b474439b82210cf57a610","Nausea","nausea",[110,118,119,111,120,112],"deliriant","miscellaneous","psychedelic",{"_id":122,"name":123,"url":124,"tags":125},"5b84b601a9a7f02682462a05","Muscle twitching","muscle-twitching",[110,111,112],{"_id":127,"name":128,"url":129,"tags":130},"5f99019e490dd83a08290c32","Shakiness","shakiness",[110,111,112],{"_id":132,"name":133,"url":134,"tags":135},"5b2839b3809a7131085cf527","Drifting","drifting",[136,120,137,138],"distortion","sensory","visual",{"_id":140,"name":141,"url":142,"tags":143},"5b4a9b3a57e0ac1a83ac634e","Thought connectivity","thought-connectivity",[144,145,146,147,120,148],"amplification","cannabinoid","cognitive","enhancement","stimulant",{"_id":150,"name":151,"url":152,"tags":153},"5b60d774f8650203ba48b050","Introspection","introspection",[146,154,120,155],"dissociative","psychological state",{"_id":157,"name":158,"url":159,"tags":160},"5b47acf0a1f46901e3750671","Geometry","geometry",[161,159,120,137,138],"geometric",{"_id":163,"name":164,"url":165,"tags":166},"5b84ad800fa2f30491ca9966","Increased perspiration","increased-perspiration",[110,111,112],{"_id":168,"name":169,"url":170,"tags":171},"5b4a59dd57e0ac1a83ac633b","Analysis enhancement","analysis-enhancement",[144,146,147,120],{"_id":173,"name":174,"url":175,"tags":176},"5b499c1fea24120b49b24b51","Auditory distortion","auditory-distortion",[177,118,136,178,119,120,137],"auditory","effect",{"_id":180,"name":181,"url":182,"tags":183},"5b834dde80b3d80353a05410","Headache","headache",[184,111,112],"neurological",{"_id":186,"name":187,"url":188,"tags":189},"5b7095186a045869c5d09a87","Bodily control enhancement","bodily-control-enhancement",[144,147,119,111,120],null,1771021849206]
