More so than any other tryptamine I have ever tried. I’m only tripping lightly but I’m honestly much more impressed with this substance than I thought I would be. It feels easy on the body, it’s not disorientating, and unlike 4-HO-MET the visual effects seem to actually have depth to them.\n\nI was initially playing retro videogames with my flatmate while cuddling and I realised that I wasn’t experiencing any deep or introspective thoughts. I decided I would try and watch episode 5 of the midnight gospel as I vaguely remembered it having a lot of deep Buddhist themes. As soon as I put it on I am absolutely blown away by how it looks and am almost overwhelmed at points throughout the episode. It left me confused and deeply contemplating a lot of the Buddhist content I have been reading recently.\n\nLater on I started cooking with my roommate. While whisking an egg I found myself visualising the history of cooking, ancient man, the development of agriculture, and the amount of technology that went into the fork I was holding, the bowl I was whisking the egg in, and the various kitchen appliances I could see around me. These are not things I would even consider for a second if I was sober, or at least not while cooking.\n\nWhen I close my eyes I see LSD like geometry. They aren’t super intense and are at about level 3. However, I can clearly see that they have potential if I were to take a higher dose. I have also been experiencing acuity enhancement, colour enhancement, and level 2 drifting that is exclusively within my peripheral vision.",[62,66],{"_id":63,"time":64,"description":65},"5f8a7661e2e8c837930fb7cc","8:22pm","I feel like I'm coming down at this point.

I'm experiencing cognitive suppressions and I feel a little more stupid than I would if I was sober. When I close my eyes I'm still seeing faint geometry and I suspect that will the case for the rest of the night.\n\nOne notable thing I saw while closing my eyes was a faint vision of the videogame I was playing earlier. However, a block in the videogame suddenly turned diagonal, an eye appeared in the middle, and the entire scene was sucked into a netted neon tunnel. This was all very faint and on a dark background but it seems that I can at least hallucinate on this substance so that's pretty cool.","I really like this substance! I'll have to try it more to develop a nuanced opinion of it. However, I have 250mg of it so going forward I intend to try increasingly high dosages while documenting its effects.
