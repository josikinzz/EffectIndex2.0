It was distinctly more colourful and clear-headed in comparison to that of other dissociatives such as ketamine, MXE, DCK, and 3-MeO-PCP.\n\nI began thinking intensely about my place within the universe and within the history of this species. I was feeling strong feelings of spiritual reverence and a profound appreciation for being alive. As I drifted through the void, my stream of consciousness started analysing my philosophical viewpoints on what was right and wrong in this world. It seemed to conclude that the universe is a neutral process with no right/wrong or better/worse unless a sentient-being applies those intellectual constructs to parts of it. I was also getting existential self-realisation and felt as if I was \"waking up\" while re-remembering who I was and what I wanted to do with my life. I felt that subjective effect documentation was the most direct way through which I could contribute to this civilisation as it would hopefully assist in legitimising and spreading the social acceptance of undergoing these incredibly beneficial states.",[92,96,100,104,108],{"_id":93,"time":94,"description":95},"5b677363fc7f8252c27084be","12:11 am","I'm coming down at this point but still feel very stimulated.",{"_id":97,"time":98,"description":99},"5b677363fc7f8252c27084bd","12:28 am","At this point, I'm trying to get ready for bed.

I also begin to notice subtle visual drifting on my bathroom floor. As I lay in bed, I begin drifting off into geometry based internal hallucinations. They shift between each other roughly every ten seconds or so. They are surprisingly complicated, but I immediately forget their details after they occur similarly to that of a dream.",{"_id":109,"time":110,"description":111},"5b677363fc7f8252c27084ba","12:00 pm","I wake up still feeling a little high, I feel euphoric and refreshed, I'm grinding my teeth a little, and I have a warm, comfortable body high. I feel very motivated","I purchased this DXM on a whim because I understood that it is a readily available classical hallucinogen that requires documentation. I was expecting to feel subtly dissociated for the evening and to derp around while watching a movie or something. Instead, I received a profound sense of spiritual reverence with shockingly profound cognitive and visual effects that easily rivalled the more mainstream psychedelics and dissociatives. Considering what it is capable of inducing, It is really hard to believe that this substance is both legal and so freely available to the general public.\n\nThis is a truly underappreciated compound with a unique pharmacology that needs to be re-evaluated by the mainstream psychonaut community. It does not feel comparable to any other dissociative and is incredibly psychedelic. I would class this substance as a psychedelic dissociative more so than merely one or the other.\n\nAlthough this was far from my first trip with this substance, it has been around six years since I have tripped on DXM. I recall having amazing experiences with it as a teenager but had somehow forgotten about this substance entirely. I now feel even more inspired to revisit the dozens of hallucinogens which I am experienced with because as an adult with a standardised methodology for documenting them, the experiences are in many ways even more profound.\n\nThanks for reading.",{"subject":114,"substances":114,"onset":114,"peak":114,"offset":114,"introduction":115,"description":115,"conclusion":114,"tags":114,"relatedEffects":114},true,false,7,[118,129,138,144,151,161,166,173,178,183,188,193,199,204,210],{"_id":119,"name":120,"url":121,"tags":122},"5b7b474439b82210cf57a610","Nausea","nausea",[123,124,125,126,127,128],"bodily","deliriant","miscellaneous","physical","psychedelic","uncomfortable",{"_id":130,"name":131,"url":132,"tags":133},"5b49a9a6ea24120b49b24b59","Cognitive disconnection","cognitive-disconnection",[134,135,136,137],"cognitive","disconnective","dissociative","novel",{"_id":139,"name":140,"url":141,"tags":142},"5ca133154c11b929c415cbe4","Gait alteration","gait-alteration",[143,126],"alteration",{"_id":145,"name":146,"url":147,"tags":148},"5b75cde36b7b4d388828c645","Stimulation","stimulation",[149,150,125,126],"amplification","enhancement",{"_id":152,"name":153,"url":154,"tags":155},"5b22c509237ad007cf1363a3","Visual acuity suppression","visual-acuity-suppression",[156,157,136,158,159,160],"antipsychotic","depressant","sensory","suppression","visual",{"_id":162,"name":163,"url":164,"tags":165},"5b84a70e0fa2f30491ca9963","Dehydration","dehydration",[123,126,128],{"_id":167,"name":168,"url":169,"tags":170},"5b4a95c357e0ac1a83ac6346","Increased sense of humor","increased-sense-of-humor",[149,171,134,150,127,172],"cannabinoid","stimulant",{"_id":174,"name":175,"url":176,"tags":177},"5b5651404227356db808661b","Thought deceleration","thought-deceleration",[156,134,157,159],{"_id":179,"name":180,"url":181,"tags":182},"5b84b3ada9a7f02682462a04","Itchiness","itchiness",[123,126,128],{"_id":184,"name":185,"url":186,"tags":187},"5b85a4c0fc5e853400adc52d","Teeth grinding","teeth-grinding",[123,126,128],{"_id":189,"name":190,"url":191,"tags":192},"5b84a9a30fa2f30491ca9965","Increased phlegm production","increased-phlegm-production",[123,126,128],{"_id":194,"name":195,"url":196,"tags":197},"5b47acf0a1f46901e3750671","Geometry","geometry",[198,196,127,158,160],"geometric",{"_id":200,"name":201,"url":202,"tags":203},"5b81b0e6f228e642f0829ce4","Changes in felt gravity","changes-in-felt-gravity",[143,136,126],{"_id":205,"name":206,"url":207,"tags":208},"5b49ac06ea24120b49b24b5c","Visual disconnection","visual-disconnection",[135,136,209,158,160],"hallucinatory state",{"_id":211,"name":212,"url":213,"tags":214},"5b634f28e5903f17623ea007","Spirituality enhancement","spirituality-enhancement",[134,127,215],"transpersonal state",{"_id":217,"bio_parsed":218,"tags":219,"not_public":114,"full_name":220,"alias":221,"email":222,"social_media":223,"bio":236,"gravatar_hash":241,"__v":242,"profile_url":243,"featured":114,"role":244,"profile_image":245},"60542430198361300fea3610",[],[],"Josie Kins","Josikinz","disregardeverythingisay@gmail.com",[224,228,232],{"type":225,"_id":226,"value":227},"reddit","60570f8534555a5df506dc55","https://reddit.com/u/josikins",{"type":229,"_id":230,"value":231},"twitter","60570f8534555a5df506dc56","https://twitter.com/josikinz",{"type":233,"_id":234,"value":235},"personal","61199fe868a28c38c14d411b","",{"_id":237,"length":238,"parsed":239,"raw":240},"64d05b22bc700c6d164d5fc9",472,"[{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Hey there, my name is Josie Kins.
