My body feels like its being rocked back and forth like its on a boat. There is an owl made of fractals on my ceiling, staring down at me. THe rest of my ceiling has taken a grid shape that extends into infinity, each square of the grid filled with flashing spiraling shapes. Beams of light crisscross my ceiling, and random flashes of light are in the corners of my vision. These fractals don't feel \"organic\" but rather much mroe synthetic, with sharper angles and edges.

They look like rainbow colored holograms. Most notably are giant flying insects-hornets and wasps and beetles. They make me feel really happy and are flying in circles all around my room. These soon get replaced by huge armored figures standing in my room. THey are wearing impractically huge fantasy armor with lots of spikes and bells and whistles, stoically standing there and watching me. They aren't vivid or realistically colored, but rather are translucent and rainbow colored. Ghost images follow everything I look it, blurring my vision, but they eventually dissolve into spiraling swirling fractals and flashing colors. Very interesting effect. The breathing of everything gets more intense. I can literally feel my room breathing, I can feel hot moist breath on me. I feel very sweaty. The walls are breathing in and out.

Looking at them, there are detailed human faces in each circle, each one looks hostile and is staring at me in some sort of unhappy manner. I don't really mind though, and I glare back at them. My computer keys are all changing in size and shape. The keyboard is lit up and rainbows are spiraling out of the light of each key, making typing hard but fascinating. Very little body load, extremely visual. Still feel like I'm on a boat/in a breathing entity. I try to stand up and realize I can't feel my legs. They feel cold and numb, but not like frozen numb, just numb like I've been sitting on them for a while. Walking is hard and I am having a hard time balancing. I sit back down, and feel immensly heavy. I feel like my insides are sloshing around like I am a water balloon.

I decide to get off my computer for about 15 minutes to really sink into the trip. I stand up and lie on my bed and stare at my ceiling and blast some music. Lights that look like comets and amorphous blobs blast across my ceiling and dance to the music. Spiraling flashing fractals extend into infinity as my ceiling becomes a field of various color and shapes. In front of this are a bunch of wasps and dragonflies flying around. I curl up like a dead bug and feel my limbs go numb. Am I dying? Doesn't matter, the world looks cool. I can see the room starting to fold up on itself, withering like me, the insects become more agitated and fly around faster. I unfold my limbs and feeling rushes back. The fractals in my ceiling become more colorful and begin to flash more excitedly and the insects fade away.

I begin lecturing people on the internet about the power of positive thinking and happiness and I honestly can do nothing but smile. Things are still flashing and making ghost images and such.
