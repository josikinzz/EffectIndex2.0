During this bike ride, I had unusually strong alterations in both my vision and cognition that I would usually associate more with psychedelic substances rather than that of THC. \n\nFor example, my vision was overly colourful in an exaggerated manner and I was experiencing mild but distinct level 3-4 geometry both within my open and closed eye vision. I also found myself deeply fixated on introspection regarding my life circumstances, my recent break up with a long term partner, and the numerous positive changes that I am making in my life and projects. These thoughts were interpreted as very therapeutic and beneficial, in a manner that I would not usually expect when simply high under the influence of cannabis.",{"_id":128,"time":129,"description":130},"60b948dee0d729172a52cf66","9:00pm","While laying in bed and cuddling with my flatmate, I was experiencing very strong sedation and had trouble keeping my eyes open.

It was definitely noticeably different from that of my experiences with THC by itself, but I have concluded that I need to try E-Cinnamal alone as soon as reasonably possible, in order to further differentiate between its effects and THC's effects. I also intend to repeat this same experiment, but with a sublingual ROA for the E-Cinnamal in order to determine if the stomach is destroying any of the active terpenes during digestion.",{"subject":142,"substances":142,"onset":142,"peak":142,"offset":142,"introduction":142,"description":88,"conclusion":142,"tags":142,"relatedEffects":142},true,"experimenting-with-e-cinnamal-in-combination-with-thc",5,{"_id":146,"bio_parsed":147,"tags":148,"not_public":142,"full_name":149,"alias":150,"email":151,"social_media":152,"bio":165,"gravatar_hash":170,"__v":144,"profile_url":171,"featured":142,"role":172,"profile_image":173},"60542430198361300fea3610",[],[],"Josie Kins","Josikinz","disregardeverythingisay@gmail.com",[153,157,161],{"type":154,"_id":155,"value":156},"reddit","60570f8534555a5df506dc55","https://reddit.com/u/josikins",{"type":158,"_id":159,"value":160},"twitter","60570f8534555a5df506dc56","https://twitter.com/josikinz",{"type":162,"_id":163,"value":164},"personal","61199fe868a28c38c14d411b","",{"_id":166,"length":167,"parsed":168,"raw":169},"64d05b22bc700c6d164d5fc9",472,"[{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Hey there, my name is Josie Kins.
