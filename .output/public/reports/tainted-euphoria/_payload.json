Initially, I experimented with one cartridge (8.4g), and it felt more like two or three – marked aural distortion, the general high of nitrous. Interestingly, it seemed to bring back the MXiPr high a little bit, and it felt like it ‘salvaged’ the experience, at least partially. Light from the Sun suddenly pouring into the room undoubtedly helped too. Encouraged, I tried inhaling three cartridges back to back, and while it was one of the most intense nitrous experiences that I ever got (I have prior experience with 4-5 cartridges), it felt like it potentiated the MXiPr only very weakly, which is strange. There is marked amnesia about the nitrous experience, and now as I am writing these words, I am actually not sure about the specifics of it. I remember thinking something like ‘lungs are your way of reproducing with the world’ or something, possibly triggered by some strange feeling when inhaling the gas, and I remember that the music sounded very distorted and somewhat ‘geometric’, whatever that means, but that’s about it.\nI considered redosing MXiPr, but ultimately decided against it, at least for now.

Most likely set being worse than I thought, but going into it, though there was some mild anxiety (which I always get when trying substances that I have little experience with), it did not feel like there was going to be much of an issue, and the entire first hour was pure pleasure. The feelings of guilt over avoiding responsibility that I had seem clearly overblown from the sober point of view, so it’s kind of strange to think that there was some unresolved guilt beneath the surface that manifested during the experience, though not impossible.\n\nNow (14. 8. 2021), as I am transcribing this report a few months after this experience, I am eager to try MXiPr again in the future. Clearly the substance has a lot of good to offer. I heard from multiple other psychonauts that the oral administration tends to lead to worse experiences than the intranasal route, so I will probably experience with it intranasally the next time I feel like taking a serotonergic dissociative.","6117e95cbb4f7a6302114003","tainted-euphoria",4,{"subject":230,"substances":230,"onset":141,"peak":141,"offset":141,"introduction":230,"description":230,"conclusion":141,"tags":230,"relatedEffects":141},true,{"_id":232,"tags":233,"user":226,"full_name":8,"alias":8,"email":234,"gravatar_hash":235,"profile_url":8,"social_media":236,"profile_image":248,"bio":249,"__v":254,"featured":230,"role":255},"611a86d9452e573c764e2342",[],"utheraptor@gmail.com","4e6d1e0a39a6543e98773d2067bf6680",[237,240,244],{"type":238,"_id":239,"value":8},"instagram","611a86d9452e573c764e2343",{"type":241,"_id":242,"value":243},"reddit","611a86d9452e573c764e2344","u/utheraptor",{"type":245,"_id":246,"value":247},"facebook","611a86d9452e573c764e2345","martin.u.durt","img/profiles/6117e95cbb4f7a6302114003/787f97dccdfcc74b.png",{"_id":250,"length":251,"parsed":252,"raw":253},"6277148c1f9ae065728e0acd",1243,"[{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Hello, I am Uther.\"]},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"I am many things - an artist, a blogger, a harm-reduction advisor... and, of course, a fellow psychonaut.
