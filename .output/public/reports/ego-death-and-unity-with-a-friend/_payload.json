Once this had been done we headed upstairs and made ourselves comfortable in a darkened room on the bed.\n\nI compiled a short musical playlist for my trip which was comprised of Friction and Mt Eden which I intended to listen to through my head phones during the experience.\n\nOnce this was done, Josikins began to light the DMT mix for me and I started to rip the bong. After taking a few hits from the bong, my visual field suddenly became extremely altered. It appeared as if I was looking through a psychedelic kaleidoscope spiral of repeating shards of inconsistently shapes triangles. These shapes did not contain colors but a continuously repeated image of my vision.",[28],{"_id":29,"time":25,"description":30},"5f80bcd19ebb180c1d4e7499","As this increased in its intensity it became clear that I could no longer continue inhaling the smoke due to a complete loss in my ability to function normally. I ceased smoking the DMT and the the bong was taken away from me as I slowly collapsed backwards on the bed with my eyes closed.\n\nAt this point I experienced total ego death. I had no knowledge of self or even physical being. All that existed was the music and the most amazing level 6 geometry comprised of intricate patterns with thousands of brilliant hues and shades that fluctuated and pulsed to the beat. This continued for several minutes until I slowly started to regain physical feeling. I realized that I felt slightly damp, then suddenly it felt like gravity was pulling me down, as I started falling into the position which I awoke from above.\n\nI sat up at the edge of the bed and opened my eyes, distortions such as visual drifting along with geometric patterns still covered my whole field of vision. I then found that the damp feeling was due to the bong being spilt slightly on me while I was tripping but I hadn't felt it until I began to reconnect with my body.",[32],{"_id":33,"time":25,"description":34},"5f80bcd19ebb180c1d4e749a","At this point my friend was also sitting next to me in the same position. I began to see a semi transparent image of myself over laid on top her. I then felt a profound sense of oneness with Josikins which lasted only minutes but during this time I felt that we were like two halves of the same whole. I realized that we were two different people but yet somehow deep down we were the same being.\n\nOnce I had sobered up enough we proceeded to head downstairs to the living room and immediately began to play the popular board game known as \"cluedo\". Throughout this I still felt a body high and minor distortions continued in my field of vision for approximately ten minutes.",{"subject":36,"substances":36,"onset":36,"peak":36,"offset":36,"introduction":8,"description":8,"conclusion":8,"tags":36,"relatedEffects":36},true,2,[39,48,54,61,68],{"_id":40,"name":41,"url":42,"tags":43},"5b47acf0a1f46901e3750671","Geometry","geometry",[44,42,45,46,47],"geometric","psychedelic","sensory","visual",{"_id":49,"name":50,"url":51,"tags":52},"5b394f3a7323db68ca54d23a","Recursion","recursion",[53,45,46,47],"distortion",{"_id":55,"name":56,"url":57,"tags":58},"5b62113b379c2707c05c694a","Unity and interconnectedness","unity-and-interconnectedness",[59,45,60],"cognitive","transpersonal state",{"_id":62,"name":63,"url":64,"tags":65},"5b49a89bea24120b49b24b58","Spontaneous tactile sensations","spontaneous-tactile-sensations",[66,45,46,67],"miscellaneous","tactile",{"_id":69,"name":70,"url":71,"tags":72},"5fb2d59784bcbf393b0c3839","Ego death","ego-death",[59,73,45,60],"dissociative",null,1771021849415]
