I still have noticable tracers, and I'm tense. A mixture disappointment, boredom and just overall being uncomfortable drove me to dose 3-HO-PCP on the comedown. This helped with my elevated heartrate and restlessness, making it easier to just relax and let the former substance wear off.","Unfortunately, this turned out to be a disappointing substance. Maybe it would have been more enjoyable to do it while walking around or doing something, as I just felt very restless and tense the entire time. Aside from an elevated heartrate and the aforementioned things, there weren't any other noticable physical effects. Headspace didn't change at all, and visuals were incredibly light. The entire time I had to try to make myself comfortable, changing up the pillows nor music didn't help.\n\nI hope to revisit this substance in the future through a different ROA, along with EPT, which someone requested me to compare against.\nI expect EPT to be similar but less potent, so I don't think I'll even bother with trying it orally first.","6117fbcdbb4f7a63021143b2","tense-and-restless",4,{"subject":86,"substances":37,"onset":37,"peak":37,"offset":37,"introduction":37,"conclusion":37,"tags":86,"relatedEffects":86},true,1771021849827]
