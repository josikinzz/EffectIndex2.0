I decided I felt ready and wanted a gentle introduction, so I ended up picking some extract in the city center and trying to quid it. In retrospect, I would prefer to try to get fresh leaves for quidding next time, or gum, at the very least, as this was a very mild (but pleasant) experience.

My friend promptly informs me that it took them around 10 to 15 minutes, which is when I realize the walls are breathing. I had been too focused on keeping the salvia in my mouth without swallowing, that I hadn't paid much attention to my surroundings.\n\nA few minutes later, I let myself swallow it, and laid back completely to meditate.",{"_id":81,"time":82,"description":83},"62e2c50ebfd049284e8c79fc","23:00"," As my eyes defocus, my surroundings just melt around me. The somewhat-small room is massive compared to me, with the grain on the wooden ceiling turning into harp strings, that were being plucked to the tune of the music I was listening to. Everything feels incredibly serene and relaxed, and I let myself drift into the visuals.\n\nAs the room changes shape and size around me, it separates into horizontal slices and tessellates over itself. I'm lying there in awe, as I had only ever heard of scenery slicing and seen replications of it, but had never experienced it myself.",{"_id":85,"time":86,"description":87},"62e2c50ebfd049284e8c79fd","23:44","I dose another 250mg of the substance, having spent the majority of the time meditating and wrapped in the covers like a cocoon.

The taste isn't gone, but it's still more pleasant without the tiny fragments of the leaves in my mouth.\n\nI turned the lights off, curious how things would be in the dark, and was immediately enveloped by sparkling fractals everywhere I looked, in the color of the lights I had just turned off. They slowly unfolded into uniform geometric shapes, with individual spots activating and rippling through my vision, as if they were rain droplets on a flat plane.\n\nI'm absolutely enthralled by this, and I spend the next while absolutely melted into my surroundings, with the geometric shapes reacting to the music and to how I was feeling.

This entire time I've felt very lucid, with very little cognitive effects or headspace changes from the substance, apart from very mild mood elevation. The intensity of the trip was entirely influenced by how relaxed I was, and if I was meditating or focused on anything at all. The experience has been comforting and wonderful, and I'm glad I had a gentle introduction to this substance. \n",{"_id":98,"time":99,"description":100},"62e2c72fbfd049284e8c7b1b","04:10","I head off to bed, without any difficulty falling asleep.","6117fbcdbb4f7a63021143b2","immensely-relaxed-and-gentle-meditation",6,null,{"subject":106,"substances":48,"onset":48,"peak":106,"offset":106,"introduction":48,"conclusion":106,"tags":106,"relatedEffects":48},true,1771021849587]
