I am absolutely rolling face in some literal sense of the word, it feels like my face is being battered with pleasure. I now feel that warm fuzzy dissociation both inside and out.

It feels like we are getting things off our chest that have gone unsaid for years. This experience is absolutely therapeutic for all of us. Various tactile sensations are extremely pleasurable, especially the feeling of running rough textures through my hands and squeezing rough textured things. I find myself obsessively kneading the same coarse blanket in my fingers for the better part of the experience. The conversation steers in a very sexual direction, as empathogens are known to do, but  I find myself feeling nothing, a continuation of the trend of drugs having a consistently inhibitory effect on my sexuality.

I feel bloated and have stomach cramps the entire day, and find myself having to urinate very frequently. The week that followed was awful. I was incredibly fatigued every single day, finding myself taking frequent and long naps. Every waking moment felt like I was half asleep. I was stricken with intense anxiety at random times for no discernible reason. Thankfully I didn't feel too many depressive symptoms, just a great deal of anxiety and fatigue.\n","The moniker \"Benzo-Fury\" that this drug sometimes bears is very deceptive (though the name is taken from its chemical structure). It is an overall mild empathogen, not as intensely stimulating or explosively euphoric as MDMA. Rather, it is a light psychedelic hypomania with a few subtle hallucinatory effects. It is not very stimulating at all, and until I redosed there was absolutely no bodyload. In general redosing seemed to greatly increase the negative physical effects with diminishing returns as far as the experience goes.
