I am feeling so warm physically and emotionally. I am very lovey dovey I want to cuddle with people, I want to bask in the warmth of their affection and attention, the fact that they forgive how obnoxious I’m being right now is a testament to our friendship… Things look more colorful, I wouldn’t say it was visual in any way other than somehow making colors seem more intense. There are some closed eyed visuals of large moving patches of color. I am still asking my friends awkwardly deep and personal questions when they just want to hang out and have fun. I ask them what gender they think I am. I am in this mindset where everything I say and do in this state will be socially profound, now is the time to ask essential questions and perform social interactions that will change the trajectories of our lives!

I am talking a lot. Like a lot. I have had personal conversations with people who I didn’t know as well before. That part is pretty cool. I feel like I have been made extremely social, almost too social to the point where the amount of empathy I express is overbearing or alienating. I just can’t shut up. But it feels like nothing can go wrong. I can only think positive thoughts and only imagine positive outcomes of every situation. Depression seems foreign- like the positive solution to everything is so obvious and easy to embrace! Of course this, once again, is just drug induced delusion. I awkwardly ask a friend who admitted a year ago to having a crush on me whether or not I’ve hurt them by being in another relationship and all. Thinking back I am heavily embarrassed for myself, I can’t believe I would just publicly put another friend on the spot like that. I am so giddy and uppity and awkward. The only impediment to socializing I can perceive is my short term memory faltering pretty often, causing me to lose track of conversations.\n",[59,63],{"_id":60,"time":61,"description":62},"5d0960cee573c21b63a2a883","T7:00","Feeling mentally stimulated, yet foggy. Imagine a train roaring through the fog. The last 7 hours are foggy in my memory, they feel like they may have been a dream. Usually, only times I’ve been on dissociatives occupy my memory in the same blurred out lo-fi way. Weird. I tested my memory earlier that night to make sure it was still functioning ok and it certainly was. It seems my short term memory has fizzled out. I feel somewhat burnt out, and the comedown almost feels disappointing. I am able to take solace in the fact that I will behave more appropriately to my peers now at least.",{"_id":64,"time":65,"description":66},"5d0960cee573c21b63a2a882","T9:00","Baseline, fall asleep.","This is actually only my second time ever taking an empathogen, and my only time taking one alone. This is dangerous stuff. I make a fool of myself every time, I get too lovey dovey, start asking people personal questions and breaching their privacy and thresholds of socialization. It would maybe be good in a setting where everyone else was on the drug, but I felt like the level of empathy I was expressing was alienating and awkward. I am an awkward person, I have never truly felt like I’ve understood or felt social conventions or empathy, merely imitated them to avoid being ostracized. This seems reflected here, but it acts in a way of justifying my alienated awkwardness. Thus I express it to my fullest capability. I have to be careful with empathogens. I really do.\nAll in all however, this one is a worthy addition to the toolkit. Perhaps its most interesting feature is its total lack of stimulation. Some have gone so far as to describe is as sedating, but I would say its effects on my body were overall neutral. It is psychedelic too, at least mentally. I adopted the same sort of hyperanalytical and sensitive mindset that psychedelics give me, which mixed well with the completely uninhibited sociability. This could be a valuable tool if I learn how to rein in the uninhibited sociability. In terms of sensor effects, there was a sort of warm numbness reminiscent of dissociatives, with a sort of momentum/springiness/lightness. Sounds sounded deeper, like not deeper in pitch but having clearly discernible layers and dimensions. Visually, the only thing noticeable was a slight color enhancement, or colors appearing warmer as if a magenta overlay was subtly applied. Close eyed visuals were abstract and mostly composed of color fields interacting with one another.",{"subject":69,"substances":69,"onset":69,"peak":69,"offset":69,"introduction":69,"description":69,"conclusion":69,"tags":69,"relatedEffects":69},true,2,[72,81,88,96],{"_id":73,"name":74,"url":75,"tags":76},"5b4a646d57e0ac1a83ac6341","Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement","empathy-affection-and-sociability-enhancement",[77,78,79,80],"amplification","cognitive","enhancement","entactogen",{"_id":82,"name":83,"url":84,"tags":85},"5b75cde36b7b4d388828c645","Stimulation","stimulation",[77,79,86,87],"miscellaneous","physical",{"_id":89,"name":90,"url":91,"tags":92},"5b198863e60c9e06f06ddcf6","Colour enhancement","colour-enhancement",[77,79,93,94,95],"psychedelic","sensory","visual",{"_id":97,"name":98,"url":99,"tags":100},"5b55184e4227356db8086611","Disinhibition","disinhibition",[101,78,102],"GABAergic","suppression",null,1771021849542]
