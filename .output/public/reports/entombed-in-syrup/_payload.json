It races down my limbs and into my being, blurring and deconstructing the world around me, turning it still and vitreous. My vision becomes nothing but a mere still image, devoid of the usual connections and associations that sensory stimuli generate. My open-eyed vision begins pulsing and flashing, as a sense of numbness and oscillating motion grips me, like great strong hands of icy static clutching my face, squeezing my arms, and wrangling my mind.

Pulses run through my body and drag its essence along with them, turning my sense of self into a warped, smeared mess.
