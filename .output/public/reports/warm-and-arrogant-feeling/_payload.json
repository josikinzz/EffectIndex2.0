Each of their curls looked like a tiny humanoid figure, and when I got closer I saw the figure had figures of itself on each of it's fingers, and so on. Recursively no matter how close up I got to look. I switched to looking at my arms and saw the figure repeated in the form of a texture all over my skin, with the details of teeth and flesh and gory figures morphing and forming on my skin.

I refrained from talking to friends because somewhere in the back of my head I knew that despite however I felt now, I should avoid maybe being brutally honest with people who don't entirely deserve it. Instead, I took to beating up myself and my terrible habits. I remarked at how painful my back was and how I somehow let myself slouch like that normally, and how poorly I took care of myself. Critiquing how poor my sleep was or how I didn't stick to my diet and workouts as much as I'd like, almost angry over how easily I let myself brush things off or make excuses to continue this awful cycle of unproductive working and terrible sleep habits, upset that I let myself get into this \"just another day\" mentality. What kind of a garbage awful person would let themselves fall back into that, let alone why would that person be me?

In reality I might be having these unfiltered raw opinions but I'm also having a blast laughing and joking around with friends, one comforted me about my former rabbits but I wasn't taking anything seriously in the moment, though still appreciative of them. I'm in a really good \"fuck you, I'm on top of the world\" mood which I very rarely ever experience, and I take the opportunity to go running with my dog.
