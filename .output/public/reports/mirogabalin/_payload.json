No noticeable anxiolysis, euphoria or sedation. There’s a faint numbness or tingling in my corregator muscles (right above each eyebrow), but I won’t rush to attribute that to the drug. No resemblance to the more ubiquitous ‘Noids.\n\nFaint facial numbness emerges. Pair that with a mild, but fairly long-lasting temple-pounding and head squeeze. Reminds me of taking a nicotine-rich drag after a long break from smoking. No euphoria within a 50 mile radius. I feel affected, but not in a way I can even functionally describe, as disappointing as that sounds.\n\nTherapeutic doses are not recreational. My thoughts seem very collected, and the “cognitive swarm” that flairs up daily, has been tranquilized. This might be a very introverted Gabapentinoid – that isn’t to say that it’s doing nothing. I feel a very Lyrica-esque dizziness coming in waves, as if this substance is desperately trying to mime a familiar state for its host, but the effect is not consistent enough.",[],[26,35],{"_id":27,"name":28,"url":29,"tags":30},"5b54ec3a2c47507065db131c","Analysis suppression","analysis-suppression",[31,32,33,34],"antipsychotic","cognitive","depressant","suppression",{"_id":36,"name":37,"url":38,"tags":39},"5b49a9a6ea24120b49b24b59","Cognitive disconnection","cognitive-disconnection",[32,40,41,42],"disconnective","dissociative","novel","2025-04-19T00:45:11.159Z","mirogabalin","1",false,null,1771021849629]
