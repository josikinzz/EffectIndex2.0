","I spent most of the day relaxing and programming afterwards, feeling very rejuvenated and in a wonderful mood. I feel like this was the perfect substance for getting settled back home after a month long vacation, and feel it was a good choice despite not having done it before. I had planned to relax in the evening after getting off the plane, but had turned out to be too tired to experience that one properly. The combined sedation and relaxation, with a clear headspace yet physical dissociation, is a really wonderful combo, and I'm excited to see what other PCP analogs hold for me.","6117fbcdbb4f7a63021143b2","comfortably-melty-and-floaty",8,{"subject":117,"substances":62,"onset":62,"peak":117,"offset":62,"introduction":62,"conclusion":62,"tags":117,"relatedEffects":62},true,null,1771021849370]
