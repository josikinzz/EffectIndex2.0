There’s a heavy police presence as well. I walk to the southernmost end of the street. I have to cross highways, and at last I reach it. It is military territory and the only non-navy building is a huge GSK building. I sit on the lawn and smoke a bowl.

Nausea is surprisingly manageable, in contrast to what I’ve read about this substance. Nothing much of note happens as I walk. I stop in a library to use the bathroom. Visuals are light, still only in the form of color enhancements. Everything just feels… strange.

I take out my headphones and WOW the auditory hallucinations are mind blowing. \n\nI close my eyes and everything fades into an absurd mess of reverberating and trailing and steely noises. They are beautiful and harmonious, like they are all bending and distorting in accordance to one another.

It was a fascinating view of the lifeblood of the city, with a thousand people going about their own unique business.

I go to the bathroom and yak up, it is horrendous and painful and uncomfortable. And here is where hell began. I do not know if this was from the substance or just a coincidentally time food poisoning. I’m as of now inclined towards thinking this is due to a mineral deficiency. I feel so sick. Usually when I’m on drugs, throwing up makes everything better. Instead, I feel worse, much much worse. I go to my room and try to smoke and distract myself, but the intense pain in my abdomen only intensifies. I spend the next 2 hours in the bathroom, I am anchored to it. I am suffering immensely, the pain is mindblowing and I empty myself out completely.\n\nI just lie facedown in the toilet, wishing it would come to an end, I try a datura seed to calm the nausea but nothing is helping, it is only intensifying. It feels like I’ve swallowed a fucking thornbush. As I am racked with pain my body is shaking wildly, like I am shivering to death. I am deathly pale in the mirror. Holy shit this sucks. I’m still tripping really hard. It’s interesting to ponder such disgusting and visceral suffering while tripping. The trip felt high pitched… it felt like there were a ton of wires being pulled taut from me, and something was strumming them all, they were waving and springing and vibrating. The visual aspect was spirals and concentric circles, I was radiating a strange thin high pitched energy.",[58,62,66],{"_id":59,"time":60,"description":61},"5f9093174e97330a29a67da0","T7:00","Some friends come over to hang out with my roommates.

I was able to keep food down at least. I was sick the next day too. This shit sucked a great deal. I did MXE a few days later and almost threw up (never happens with MXE) I guess because my digestive system was still raw. Anyways, aside from this, it was an interesting psychedelic, it had a nature of being very taut, springy, and vibrate-y. It was thin and high pitched but harmonious. I want to try it again, to see if the nausea really was from the drug or was some other factor.
