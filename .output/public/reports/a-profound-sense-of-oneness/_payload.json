Looking to pass the time in the bath, I decided to shave, but the nausea kicked in sooner than I thought and it was pretty difficult. During the nausea, I began getting weird thoughts about “fighting the nausea.” ",[31],{"_id":32,"time":33,"description":34},"5f8298769ebb180c1d4e7504","4:20 pm"," About an hour in, the nausea went away and I began to feel like I was tripping. At one point, I felt like I was having a bad trip or had stopped tripping completely. I felt like the 4-aco-dmt hadn’t worked after all. I was ready to go back to my computer or back to bed when I figured I’d try to go outside.\n\nWhen I got outside, my trip totally changed. I saw beautiful visuals. At one point, I saw Obama (United States president) visuals everywhere. I saw visuals of multiple presidents on the underpass near my apartment. I felt like I was taking ‘the walk to enlightenment’ or something. I started seeing pyramid eye visuals everywhere. I saw faces in the sky. There was a black baby looking down at me from the sky. The wind became a part of me. I became a part of everything. A sense of oneness overcame me. I was so excited I started laughing out loud because I had realized the answer to the universe. I couldn’t stop smiling and laughing. I felt amazing.\n\nI wrote down:\n\n*\"Wow. Never before have I realized the oneness of it all. We all are one. Even now, while tripping, I see eyes. A pyramid of an eye. I have seen the truth. Wow. I have figured out the universe. The oneness was a circle. The universe is a circle.\"*\n\nI was able to connect myself with all objects — rocks, the wind, other people. I thought it was beautiful how two people could find each other. How your consciousness can cling to a different shell of itself. Sex was beautiful for this reason. It allowed your consciousness to become one.\n\nEvery time I would go inside to go to the bathroom, I would start having a bad trip. To aid this, I started singing. I listened to Vanessa Carlton’s music while tripping and it was fucking amazing. Music has never sounded better. And the things she would sing would sometimes connect with my thought processes. I could find meaning in her lyrics, meanings that weren’t there before.\n\nI realized that for love to exist, hate must exist. For anger to exist, peace must exist. Yin and yang. Opposite forces need each other for each to exist. I wanted to become a shell of peace and compassion.\n\nAfter walking for a while, I decided to head back in. I knew that if i went inside now, I would not be able to trip further. But I decided to head inside to record my thoughts about the trip.\n\nUnfortunately, I wasn’t really able to get anything out in words. This is what I wrote on Microsoft Word:\n\n*\"wow. the wind*\n\n*wow*\n\n*wow*\n\n*wow*\n\n*i can’t even describe it*\n\n*WE ARE ALL ONE*\n\n*i don’t even know how to explain it.*\n\n*it*\n\n*is something you FEEL*\n\n*go back outside lol\"*\n\nBut it was cold and windy, so I decided to stay in. I was done with my trip for today. Hours later, I look on my phone and see that while outside I had written:\n\n\n*\"The oneness of it all is fucking Incredible fucking incredible. We sre all one. I am this rock. Circle. The oneness of it all. Remember it. You have been given a glimpse\"*",[],{"subject":37,"substances":37,"onset":37,"peak":37,"offset":37,"introduction":8,"description":8,"conclusion":8,"tags":37,"relatedEffects":37},true,7,[40,51,59,64,71,79],{"_id":41,"name":42,"url":43,"tags":44},"5b7b474439b82210cf57a610","Nausea","nausea",[45,46,47,48,49,50],"bodily","deliriant","miscellaneous","physical","psychedelic","uncomfortable",{"_id":52,"name":53,"url":54,"tags":55},"5b478ac8a1f46901e375066f","Transformations","transformations",[56,49,57,58],"hallucinatory state","sensory","visual",{"_id":60,"name":61,"url":62,"tags":63},"5b43da488b36395c86339041","External hallucination","external-hallucination",[46,56,57,58],{"_id":65,"name":66,"url":67,"tags":68},"5b62113b379c2707c05c694a","Unity and interconnectedness","unity-and-interconnectedness",[69,49,70],"cognitive","transpersonal state",{"_id":72,"name":73,"url":74,"tags":75},"5b4a953657e0ac1a83ac6345","Increased music appreciation","increased-music-appreciation",[76,77,69,78,49],"amplification","cannabinoid","enhancement",{"_id":80,"name":81,"url":82,"tags":83},"5b634368e5903f17623ea004","Perception of interdependent opposites","perception-of-interdependent-opposites",[69,70],null,1771021849225]
