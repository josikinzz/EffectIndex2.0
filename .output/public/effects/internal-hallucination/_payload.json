It can be described as a short-term detachment from one’s immediate surroundings; during which, a person’s contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by an ill-defined fantasy.

Typically, it also occurs alongside relevant [int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-hallucination\"]auditory[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/tactile-hallucination\"]tactile hallucinations[/int-link], as well as the sensation that a person has become completely disconnected from their physical body.[/headered-textbox]\n\nOutside of this levelling system, the subjective intensity of internal hallucinations are not only dependent on their detail or level of immersion, but also upon the speed and rate at which they successively occur between each other. For example, during the experience of internal hallucinations, it is possible to find oneself in a state that presents a relentless stream of intensely vivid hallucinations. This occurs at such a rapid rate that it eventually becomes psychologically exhausting to endure them, regardless of their thematic content. The sheer amount of content experienced in this state often results in powerful [int-link to=\"/effects/time-distortion?s=Time-dilation\"]time dilation[/int-link], which seems to stem from the fact that abnormally large amounts of experiences are being felt in very short periods of time. This is also consistently accompanied by states of sensory overload and [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link] in a manner that can subjectively feel as if it is a consequence of the brain allocating all of its processing power into rendering hallucinations at the expense of other cognitive faculties.\n\nThe content within these internal hallucinations can be further broken down into four distinct sub-components.

At their higher levels, they can offer a near infinite wealth of experiences and show people things so unfathomable that it will often cause them to question how these hallucinations could possibly even originate from their own mind. It has always fascinated me that the brain is quite capable of instantaneously rendering scenes and images that are so detailed, intricate, and vivid that they are often incomprehensible beyond anything that could ever occur within the real world.[/p]\\n\\n[p]However, after a lot of contemplation and experiences with both hallucinatory states and lucid dreaming, I now strongly suspect that internal hallucinations are quite likely to be the drug induced equivalent of the various scenes that most people commonly encounter within their [int-link to=\\\"/effects/dreams/\\\"]dreams[/int-link]. This is because there are a number of interesting commonalities between dreams and hallucinations that are too substantial for me to ignore. For example, I think it is interesting that when leaving something such as a sudden onset hallucination, there is often a feeling of amnesia that's identical to the feeling of waking up from a dream. Alongside of this, there is often an identical sense of plot acceptance within both dreams and hallucinations that results in the person immediately accepting their current situation as a real life event.[/p]\\n\\n[p]From personal experience, I can also confirm that the well established \\\"reality checks\\\" that can be used within Lucid Dreams to determine whether or not one is currently awake or asleep, do in fact work just as well within high-level drug induced hallucinations. For example, within a dream, subtle details such as written text and clock faces are seemingly incapable of rendering in a static manner. So if a person looks at one of these things, takes note of them, looks away, and then looks back, they will find without fail that the content suddenly changes its appearance each and every single time. This is also true for internal hallucinations in exactly the same manner.[/p]\\n\\n[p]On a less important note, I think it's interesting to consider that the leveling system listed above can not only be applied to internal hallucinations, but can also be applied to the experience of hypnagogia and fully fledged dreams without any significant modifications to its wording.

At their higher levels, they can offer a near infinite wealth of experiences and show people things so unfathomable that it will often cause them to question how these hallucinations could possibly even originate from their own mind. It has always fascinated me that the brain is quite capable of instantaneously rendering scenes and images that are so detailed, intricate, and vivid that they are often incomprehensible beyond anything that could ever occur within the real world.[/p]\n\n[p]However, after a lot of contemplation and experiences with both hallucinatory states and lucid dreaming, I now strongly suspect that internal hallucinations are quite likely to be the drug induced equivalent of the various scenes that most people commonly encounter within their [int-link to=\"/effects/dreams/\"]dreams[/int-link]. This is because there are a number of interesting commonalities between dreams and hallucinations that are too substantial for me to ignore. For example, I think it is interesting that when leaving something such as a sudden onset hallucination, there is often a feeling of amnesia that's identical to the feeling of waking up from a dream. Alongside of this, there is often an identical sense of plot acceptance within both dreams and hallucinations that results in the person immediately accepting their current situation as a real life event.[/p]\n\n[p]From personal experience, I can also confirm that the well established \"reality checks\" that can be used within Lucid Dreams to determine whether or not one is currently awake or asleep, do in fact work just as well within high-level drug induced hallucinations. For example, within a dream, subtle details such as written text and clock faces are seemingly incapable of rendering in a static manner. So if a person looks at one of these things, takes note of them, looks away, and then looks back, they will find without fail that the content suddenly changes its appearance each and every single time. This is also true for internal hallucinations in exactly the same manner.[/p]\n\n[p]On a less important note, I think it's interesting to consider that the leveling system listed above can not only be applied to internal hallucinations, but can also be applied to the experience of hypnagogia and fully fledged dreams without any significant modifications to its wording. Alongside of this, the levelling system that I devised to measure the coherency of an autonomous entities communication methods can also be perfectly applied to that of dream characters without any modification at all. This was completely unintentional for both of these leveling systems and is, in my personal opinion, not a coincidence.[/p]\n\n[p]Although it could be argued that internal hallucinations are too characteristically different from that of dreams to possibly stem from the similar neurological processes, I think that these differences in their presentation are largely the result of the many other effects that are often simultaneously occurring during these experiences.

attempts to accurately portray and replicate the experience of psychedelic level 7 geometry combined with level 5 internal hallucinations.\" align=\"right\" top=\"true\" /]\n[p]An [b]internal hallucination[/b] is the perception of a visual hallucination that exclusively occurs within an imagined environment that can typically only be viewed with closed eyes,[ref to=\"1\" /][ref to=\"2\" /] similar to those found within [int-link to=\"/effects/dreams\"]dreams[/int-link].[ref to=\"3\" /][ref to=\"4\" /][ref to=\"5\" /] This is in stark contrast to [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link], which display themselves seamlessly into the person's surrounding environment as if they were physically present.[/p]\n\n[p]At [i]lower levels[/i], internal hallucinations begin with imagery on the back of a person's eyelids, which do not take up the entirety of one's visual field and are distinct from their background. These can be described as spontaneous moving or still images of scenes, concepts, places, or anything one could imagine. The imagery is manifested in varying levels of realism ranging from ill-defined and cartoon-like to wholly realistic. They rarely hold their form for more than a few seconds before fading or shifting into another image. It is worth noting that this level of intensity occurs in a manner similar to that of hypnagogia, the state between sleep and wakefulness.[/p]\n\n[p]At [i]higher levels[/i], internal hallucinations become increasingly elaborate as they eventually become all-encompassing, fully-fledged 3D scenes that surround the person in a manner similar to that of [int-link to=\"/effects/dreams\"]dreams[/int-link]. This can create the feeling that one has \"broken-through\" into another reality. The things that occur within this perceived alternate reality can be anything, but fall under common archetypes such as contact with [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link], alongside a wide variety of [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]imagined landscapes[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]scenarios[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]This effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 5 different levels of intensity described below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Enhancement of mental visualization\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, internal hallucinations can be defined as the distinct enhancement of mental visualisation that a person drifts into while daydreaming or using their imagination. It can be described as a short-term detachment from one’s immediate surroundings; during which, a person’s contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by an ill-defined fantasy. The details of this internal visualisation are chosen in a slightly spontaneous or autonomous nature, but are mostly consciously controlled by the content of one’s current thought stream.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, internal hallucinations consist of partially defined, blurred, and faded imagery within a person’s visual field. This is where the content of these hallucinations usually becomes more spontaneous in nature and out of the person’s conscious control.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the vividness and intensity increases in a fashion that renders the imagery seen within one’s visual field as fully defined and realistic in its appearance.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the vividness, scope, and intensity of the hallucinations become all-encompassing in a way that displays momentary flashes of scenes that surround the person in an immersive environment, similar to that of a vague dream. Although all-encompassing, they are often blurred or transparent in appearance and the person’s physical senses remain partially connected to the real world.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the highest level, the internal hallucinations further increase to become all-encompassing in a manner that displays long-lasting scenes surrounding the person with an explorable and fully immersive environment similar to that of a dream. This occurs in a fashion that is fully detailed and highly vivid in its appearance. Typically, it also occurs alongside relevant [int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-hallucination\"]auditory[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/tactile-hallucination\"]tactile hallucinations[/int-link], as well as the sensation that a person has become completely disconnected from their physical body.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]Outside of this levelling system, the subjective intensity of internal hallucinations are not only dependent on their detail or level of immersion, but also upon the speed and rate at which they successively occur between each other. For example, during the experience of internal hallucinations, it is possible to find oneself in a state that presents a relentless stream of intensely vivid hallucinations. This occurs at such a rapid rate that it eventually becomes psychologically exhausting to endure them, regardless of their thematic content. The sheer amount of content experienced in this state often results in powerful [int-link to=\"/effects/time-distortion?s=Time-dilation\"]time dilation[/int-link], which seems to stem from the fact that abnormally large amounts of experiences are being felt in very short periods of time. This is also consistently accompanied by states of sensory overload and [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link] in a manner that can subjectively feel as if it is a consequence of the brain allocating all of its processing power into rendering hallucinations at the expense of other cognitive faculties.[/p]\n\n[p]The content within these internal hallucinations can be further broken down into four distinct sub-components. These are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, each of which are listed below:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity/\"]Autonomous entities[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/perspective-hallucination/\"]Perspective hallucinations[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]Scenarios and plots[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes/\"]Settings, Sceneries, and Landscapes[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]It is worth noting that the content, style, and general behaviour of an internal hallucination is often largely dependent on the emotional state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person who is emotionally stable and generally happy will usually be more prone to experiencing neutral, interesting, or positive hallucinations. In contrast, however, a person who is emotionally unstable and generally unhappy will usually be more prone to experiencing sinister, fear-inducing, and negative hallucinations.[/p]\n\n[p]Internal hallucinations are often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link]. They are most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/visual\"]psychedelics[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociatives[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants\"]deliriants[/int-link].

The imagery is manifested in varying levels of realism ranging from ill-defined and cartoon-like to wholly realistic.

This is because there are a number of interesting commonalities between dreams and hallucinations that are too substantial for me to ignore. For example, I think it is interesting that when leaving something such as a sudden onset hallucination, there is often a feeling of amnesia that's identical to the feeling of waking up from a dream.
