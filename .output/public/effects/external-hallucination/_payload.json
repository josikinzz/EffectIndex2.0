levels of intensity described below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Fleeting hallucinations\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, external hallucinations generally consist of movement within the peripheral vision and ill-defined, fleeting hallucinations that disappear once a person double takes.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Vaguely defined hallucinations\" labelBackground=\"#999997\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the hallucinations are visible within one's direct line of sight, but are not fully defined in their appearance. This means that, although visible, they do not look completely detailed and are often extremely blurry or semi-translucent with little to no colour.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Partially defined hallucinations\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the hallucinations become distinct enough in their detail and vividness to extend beyond transparent, colourless, or blurry manifestations.

They are now capable of a completely convincing and photorealistic appearance and their behaviour becomes far more lifelike. Additionally, they may become numerous enough to fully engulf the entirety of the person's environment.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]Alongside a specific levelling system, there are also environmental factors that directly alter both the likelihood of external hallucinations manifesting themselves and the level of detail they are rendered at. For example, the more unfamiliar with the external environment a person is, the more likely it is that this effect will manifest itself. Cluttered areas tend to produce more external hallucinations. The amount of light within a room is inversely proportional to the intensity of them, with less light leading to significantly more hallucinations and more light leading to fewer, although more detailed, hallucinations.[/p]\n\n[p]The content within these external hallucinations can be further broken down into four distinct subcomponents. These are described and documented within their own dedicated articles, each of which are listed below:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]Autonomous entities[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"effects/object-activation\"]Object activation[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/perspective-hallucination\"]Perspective hallucinations[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]Scenarios and plots[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]Settings, sceneries, and landscapes[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[li][b][int-link to=\"/effects/shadow-people\"]Shadow people[/int-link][/b][/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]It is worth noting that the content, style, and general behaviour of an external hallucination is often largely dependent on the emotional state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person who is emotionally stable and generally happy will usually be more prone to experiencing neutral, interesting, or positive hallucinations. In contrast, a person who is emotionally unstable and generally unhappy will usually be more prone to experiencing sinister, fear-inducing, and negative hallucinations.[/p]\n\n[p]External hallucinations are often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/delirium\"]delirium[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link].
