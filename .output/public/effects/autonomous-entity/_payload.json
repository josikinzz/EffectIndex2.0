While some entities do not seem to be aware of a person's presence, others are often precognizant of a person's appearance into their realm and usually choose to interact with them in various ways. For example, they will often display behaviours such as showing a person around the realm that they inhabit, presenting them with objects, holding spontaneous celebrations of their arrival, engaging them in conversation, merging into and out of the person's body or consciousness, and attempting to impart knowledge of various kinds.[/p]\n\n[toc /]\n\n[p]Entities can take any form, but certain archetypes are present and commonly include:[/p]\n\n[p][i]Humans[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"4\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"3\" /] [i]shadow people, bodiless super intelligent humanoids, aliens[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"5\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"4\" /] [i]elves[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"6\" /] [i]animals[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"7\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"5\" /] [i]giant spheres, insectoids[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"8\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"6\" /] [i]beings of light, anthropomorphic beings[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"9\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"7\" /] [i]plants[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"10\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"8\" /] [i]conscious inanimate objects, fictional characters, cartoons, robotic machines, gods[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"11\" /] [i]demigods, goddesses, bio-mechanical intelligences, hooded figures, demons, indescribable monstrosities, spirits[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"12\" /] [i]angels[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"13\" /] [i]shamans, ghosts, souls, ancestors, fantastical or mythological beasts, glitch creatures, and more[/i].[/p]\n\n[p]The appearance, personality, and behaviour of an autonomous entity often correlates with the psychological state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person with a positive mindset will more commonly experience loving, kind, and healing entities. In contrast, a person with a negative mindset may experience hateful, sinister, and mocking entities.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of their overall visibility and clarity, this effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 3 different levels of intensity described below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Vaguely defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, autonomous entities generally consist of poorly defined outlines and silhoettes that are barely distinguishable from the background behind them.

This means that, although clearly visible, they do not look completely detailed and are often blurry or semi-translucent. At this point, it also becomes more common to feel a sense of general intent and personality attributed to the entity.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the autonomous entities become distinct enough in their detail and vividness to extend beyond transparent, colourless, or blurry manifestations. They are now capable of a completely convincing and photorealistic appearance and their behaviour also becomes far more lifelike.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]The experience of seeing autonomous entities is also often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link],[ref to=\"5\" no=\"2\" /] [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link]. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/visual\"]psychedelics[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociatives[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants\"]deliriants[/int-link]. However, it can also occur under the influence of stimulant psychosis, with extreme sleep deprivation, or during dreams.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2 id=\"communication-styles\"]Communication Styles[/h2]\n[p]Autonomous entities can communicate with a person via a combination of spoken word, “telepathy”, conceptual thoughts, choreographed movements, mathematics, and geometry-based visual linguistics that generally consist of morphing coloured structures of different textures that are innately understandable as representations of specific concepts. They will often convey insights regarding overcoming personal issues within a person’s life and will occasionally help clarify philosophical or spiritual ideas. However, more often than not, entities are very likely to speak in a cryptic or nonsensical manner that seems to have no clear meaning behind it.[/p]\n\n[p]It is important to note that autonomous entities can never convey novel information to the person experiencing them. For example, they cannot provide insights about the external world that a person did not already know on some level. Instead, they can only provide alternative perspectives and help build upon existing ideas. This is presumably because autonomous entities do not have access to any knowledge not already contained within one's conscious or subconscious memories.[/p]\n\n[p]When communicated with through spoken word, the level of coherency in which these entities can communicate with is highly variable but can be broken down into five distinct levels. These are described and listed below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Silence\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, the effect can be described as a complete unresponsiveness from the entity and a lack of speech despite their presence within the hallucination.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses and noises that almost sound like words but do not contain any real content or meaning beyond a vague sense of emotional intent.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as audible linguistic conversational responses and noises that contain fully defined and understandable words, but often lack grammatical structure or an overall sense of general coherency.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain fully defined and understandable words with a partially defined grammatical structure and general coherency. It conveys its point on a level that is frequently coherent, but may not always be fully understandable and will sometimes descend into broken grammar or even gibberish.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the highest level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain understandable words and fully defined grammatical sentence structures. It has an overall sense of general coherency, which conveys its point in a level of detail that is genuinely on par with that of a person’s own intellect.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2 id=\"personality-types\"]Personality Types[/h2]\n[p]Autonomous entities will often embody at least one of a few approximate personality types. Although there is considerable overlap between them, these personality types can typically be identified primarily through their behaviour, their appearance, and an innate sense of their character that is often felt during the interaction.[/p] \n\n[p]The individual types are broken down and described within the four separate categories listed below:[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-characters\"]Representations of characters[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any hallucinatory character that the brain has either spontaneously generated during the trip or was already aware of at a prior time. These entities can include newly hallucinated characters of any sort, people that the person has met in real life, people that the person is aware of as existing in the real world, or characters from fictional media. These entities will usually adopt an appropriate personality and set of mannerisms to fit the chosen concept with an impressive degree of detail. An example of this might be meeting an insectoid mantis like creature that is playing the role of a shamanic teacher and acting accordingly. Another might include meeting the hallucination of a deceased loved one or a currently living family friend.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-ideas-and-concepts\"]Representations of ideas and concepts[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any known concept or idea. These specific concepts could include personified representations of abstract ideas, events, and emotions. An example of this might be meeting a mocking jester that feels and acts as if it represents one's own insecurities. Another might include meeting a group of hooded figures that feel as if they represent the very concept of organized religion itself.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-the-subconscious\"]Representations of the subconscious[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as an entity that may take any visible form, but is also subjectively perceived to be an autonomous controller behind the continuous generation of the details of the person’s current hallucinations. They may also be felt to simultaneously control or manage one’s current perspective, personality, and internally stored model of reality. When interacted with, this category of entity can often possess abilities that allow them to directly alter and manipulate one’s current experiences. They commonly want to teach or guide the person and will operate under the assumption that they know what is best for them. However, although a relatively common experience, it still cannot be known whether this type of autonomous entity is genuinely a representation of the \"subconscious\" or is merely an approximation that behaves in a convincing manner.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-the-self\"]Representations of the self[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a direct copy of one’s own personality. It can take any visible form, but when conversed with, it clearly adopts an identical vocabulary and set of mannerisms to one’s own consciousness. This entity will often take on a similar appearance to oneself, but could theoretically take on any other appearance too. During this experience, there is also a distinct feeling that one's own consciousness is somehow being mirrored and duplicated into the hallucinated autonomous entity that is being interacted with.[/p]\n","[{\"type\":\"string\",\"value\":\"[captioned-image src=\\\"/img/gallery/Namaste_(Trifoliata_Mystica)_by_Luke_Brown.jpg\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" artist=\\\"Luke Brown\\\" title=\\\"Namaste\\n\\\" align=\\\"right\\\" top=\\\"true\\\" border=\\\"true\\\" /][p]An [b]autonomous entity[/b] is the experience of perceived contact with hallucinated beings that appear to be sentient and autonomous in their behaviour.[ref to=\\\"1\\\" /][ref to=\\\"2\\\" /][ref to=\\\"3\\\" /][ref to=\\\"4\\\" no=\\\"1\\\" /][ref to=\\\"5\\\" no=\\\"1\\\" /][ref to=\\\"6\\\" /][ref to=\\\"7\\\" no=\\\"1\\\" /][ref to=\\\"8\\\" no=\\\"1\\\" /][ref to=\\\"9\\\" no=\\\"1\\\" /] These entities can manifest within both [int-link to=\\\"external-hallucination\\\"]external[/int-link] and [int-link to=\\\"internal-hallucination\\\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link].[ref to=\\\"8\\\" no=\\\"2\\\" /][/p]\\n\\n[p]Autonomous entities will frequently act as the inhabitants of a perceived independent reality.[ref to=\\\"7\\\" no=\\\"2\\\" /] They most commonly appear alone but can also often be within small or large groups alongside of other entities.

It conveys its point on a level that is frequently coherent, but may not always be fully understandable and will sometimes descend into broken grammar or even gibberish.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 5\\\" header=\\\"Fully defined coherent speech\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#555554\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]At the highest level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain understandable words and fully defined grammatical sentence structures. It has an overall sense of general coherency, which conveys its point in a level of detail that is genuinely on par with that of a person’s own intellect.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[hr /]\\n\\n[h2 id=\\\"personality-types\\\"]Personality Types[/h2]\\n[p]Autonomous entities will often embody at least one of a few approximate personality types. Although there is considerable overlap between them, these personality types can typically be identified primarily through their behaviour, their appearance, and an innate sense of their character that is often felt during the interaction.[/p] \\n\\n[p]The individual types are broken down and described within the four separate categories listed below:[/p]\\n[h3 id=\\\"representations-of-characters\\\"]Representations of characters[/h3]\\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any hallucinatory character that the brain has either spontaneously generated during the trip or was already aware of at a prior time. These entities can include newly hallucinated characters of any sort, people that the person has met in real life, people that the person is aware of as existing in the real world, or characters from fictional media. These entities will usually adopt an appropriate personality and set of mannerisms to fit the chosen concept with an impressive degree of detail. An example of this might be meeting an insectoid mantis like creature that is playing the role of a shamanic teacher and acting accordingly. Another might include meeting the hallucination of a deceased loved one or a currently living family friend.[/p]\\n[h3 id=\\\"representations-of-ideas-and-concepts\\\"]Representations of ideas and concepts[/h3]\\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any known concept or idea. These specific concepts could include personified representations of abstract ideas, events, and emotions. An example of this might be meeting a mocking jester that feels and acts as if it represents one's own insecurities. Another might include meeting a group of hooded figures that feel as if they represent the very concept of organized religion itself.[/p]\\n[h3 id=\\\"representations-of-the-subconscious\\\"]Representations of the subconscious[/h3]\\n[p]This personality type can be described as an entity that may take any visible form, but is also subjectively perceived to be an autonomous controller behind the continuous generation of the details of the person’s current hallucinations. They may also be felt to simultaneously control or manage one’s current perspective, personality, and internally stored model of reality. When interacted with, this category of entity can often possess abilities that allow them to directly alter and manipulate one’s current experiences. They commonly want to teach or guide the person and will operate under the assumption that they know what is best for them. However, although a relatively common experience, it still cannot be known whether this type of autonomous entity is genuinely a representation of the \\\"subconscious\\\" or is merely an approximation that behaves in a convincing manner.[/p]\\n[h3 id=\\\"representations-of-the-self\\\"]Representations of the self[/h3]\\n[p]This personality type can be described as a direct copy of one’s own personality. It can take any visible form, but when conversed with, it clearly adopts an identical vocabulary and set of mannerisms to one’s own consciousness. This entity will often take on a similar appearance to oneself, but could theoretically take on any other appearance too. During this experience, there is also a distinct feeling that one's own consciousness is somehow being mirrored and duplicated into the hallucinated autonomous entity that is being interacted with.[/p]\\n\"}]","An autonomous entity is the experience of perceived contact with beings that appear to be sentient in their behaviour.

Instead, I am quite sure that they are simply the psychedelic equivalent of the various characters and beings that most people commonly encounter within their dreams. Although it could be argued that autonomous entities are too characteristically different from that of dream characters to possibly be a result of the same neurological processes, I think that these differences in their appearance and behaviour are largely the result of the many other psychedelic effects that are simultaneously occurring during these encounters. The most notable one is geometry, which causes the hallucination to be comprised of the otherworldly shapes and patterns that provide autonomous entities with their distinctly \\\"hyperspatial\\\" aesthetic.

within both [int-link to=\"external-hallucination\"]external[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link].[ref to=\"8\" no=\"2\" /][/p]\n\n[p]Autonomous entities will frequently act as the inhabitants of a perceived independent reality.[ref to=\"7\" no=\"2\" /] They most commonly appear alone but can also often be within small or large groups alongside of other entities. While some entities do not seem to be aware of a person's presence, others are often precognizant of a person's appearance into their realm and usually choose to interact with them in various ways. For example, they will often display behaviours such as showing a person around the realm that they inhabit, presenting them with objects, holding spontaneous celebrations of their arrival, engaging them in conversation, merging into and out of the person's body or consciousness, and attempting to impart knowledge of various kinds.[/p]\n\n[toc /]\n\n[p]Entities can take any form, but certain archetypes are present and commonly include:[/p]\n\n[p][i]Humans[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"4\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"3\" /] [i]shadow people, bodiless super intelligent humanoids, aliens[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"5\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"4\" /] [i]elves[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"6\" /] [i]animals[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"7\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"5\" /] [i]giant spheres, insectoids[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"8\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"6\" /] [i]beings of light, anthropomorphic beings[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"9\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"7\" /] [i]plants[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"10\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"8\" /] [i]conscious inanimate objects, fictional characters, cartoons, robotic machines, gods[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"11\" /] [i]demigods, goddesses, bio-mechanical intelligences, hooded figures, demons, indescribable monstrosities, spirits[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"12\" /] [i]angels[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"13\" /] [i]shamans, ghosts, souls, ancestors, fantastical or mythological beasts, glitch creatures, and more[/i].[/p]\n\n[p]The appearance, personality, and behaviour of an autonomous entity often correlates with the psychological state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person with a positive mindset will more commonly experience loving, kind, and healing entities. In contrast, a person with a negative mindset may experience hateful, sinister, and mocking entities.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of their overall visibility and clarity, this effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 3 different levels of intensity described below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Vaguely defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, autonomous entities generally consist of poorly defined outlines and silhoettes that are barely distinguishable from the background behind them. However, this is still often accompanied by a distinct feeling of \"[int-link to=\"/effects/sensed-presence\"]sensed presence[/int-link]\".[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#8f8e8d\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, autonomous entities become entirely visible within one’s visual field and distinguishable from their background, but are not fully defined in their appearance. This means that, although clearly visible, they do not look completely detailed and are often blurry or semi-translucent. At this point, it also becomes more common to feel a sense of general intent and personality attributed to the entity.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the autonomous entities become distinct enough in their detail and vividness to extend beyond transparent, colourless, or blurry manifestations. They are now capable of a completely convincing and photorealistic appearance and their behaviour also becomes far more lifelike.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]The experience of seeing autonomous entities is also often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link],[ref to=\"5\" no=\"2\" /] [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link]. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/visual\"]psychedelics[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociatives[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants\"]deliriants[/int-link]. However, it can also occur under the influence of stimulant psychosis, with extreme sleep deprivation, or during dreams.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2 id=\"communication-styles\"]Communication Styles[/h2]\n[p]Autonomous entities can communicate with a person via a combination of spoken word, “telepathy”, conceptual thoughts, choreographed movements, mathematics, and geometry-based visual linguistics that generally consist of morphing coloured structures of different textures that are innately understandable as representations of specific concepts. They will often convey insights regarding overcoming personal issues within a person’s life and will occasionally help clarify philosophical or spiritual ideas. However, more often than not, entities are very likely to speak in a cryptic or nonsensical manner that seems to have no clear meaning behind it.[/p]\n\n[p]It is important to note that autonomous entities can never convey novel information to the person experiencing them. For example, they cannot provide insights about the external world that a person did not already know on some level. Instead, they can only provide alternative perspectives and help build upon existing ideas. This is presumably because autonomous entities do not have access to any knowledge not already contained within one's conscious or subconscious memories.[/p]\n\n[p]When communicated with through spoken word, the level of coherency in which these entities can communicate with is highly variable but can be broken down into five distinct levels. These are described and listed below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Silence\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, the effect can be described as a complete unresponsiveness from the entity and a lack of speech despite their presence within the hallucination.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses and noises that almost sound like words but do not contain any real content or meaning beyond a vague sense of emotional intent.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as audible linguistic conversational responses and noises that contain fully defined and understandable words, but often lack grammatical structure or an overall sense of general coherency.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain fully defined and understandable words with a partially defined grammatical structure and general coherency. It conveys its point on a level that is frequently coherent, but may not always be fully understandable and will sometimes descend into broken grammar or even gibberish.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the highest level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain understandable words and fully defined grammatical sentence structures. It has an overall sense of general coherency, which conveys its point in a level of detail that is genuinely on par with that of a person’s own intellect.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2 id=\"personality-types\"]Personality Types[/h2]\n[p]Autonomous entities will often embody at least one of a few approximate personality types. Although there is considerable overlap between them, these personality types can typically be identified primarily through their behaviour, their appearance, and an innate sense of their character that is often felt during the interaction.[/p] \n\n[p]The individual types are broken down and described within the four separate categories listed below:[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-characters\"]Representations of characters[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any hallucinatory character that the brain has either spontaneously generated during the trip or was already aware of at a prior time. These entities can include newly hallucinated characters of any sort, people that the person has met in real life, people that the person is aware of as existing in the real world, or characters from fictional media. These entities will usually adopt an appropriate personality and set of mannerisms to fit the chosen concept with an impressive degree of detail. An example of this might be meeting an insectoid mantis like creature that is playing the role of a shamanic teacher and acting accordingly. Another might include meeting the hallucination of a deceased loved one or a currently living family friend.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-ideas-and-concepts\"]Representations of ideas and concepts[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any known concept or idea. These specific concepts could include personified representations of abstract ideas, events, and emotions. An example of this might be meeting a mocking jester that feels and acts as if it represents one's own insecurities. Another might include meeting a group of hooded figures that feel as if they represent the very concept of organized religion itself.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-the-subconscious\"]Representations of the subconscious[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as an entity that may take any visible form, but is also subjectively perceived to be an autonomous controller behind the continuous generation of the details of the person’s current hallucinations. They may also be felt to simultaneously control or manage one’s current perspective, personality, and internally stored model of reality. When interacted with, this category of entity can often possess abilities that allow them to directly alter and manipulate one’s current experiences. They commonly want to teach or guide the person and will operate under the assumption that they know what is best for them. However, although a relatively common experience, it still cannot be known whether this type of autonomous entity is genuinely a representation of the \"subconscious\" or is merely an approximation that behaves in a convincing manner.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-the-self\"]Representations of the self[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a direct copy of one’s own personality. It can take any visible form, but when conversed with, it clearly adopts an identical vocabulary and set of mannerisms to one’s own consciousness. This entity will often take on a similar appearance to oneself, but could theoretically take on any other appearance too. During this experience, there is also a distinct feeling that one's own consciousness is somehow being mirrored and duplicated into the hallucinated autonomous entity that is being interacted with.[/p]\n","[{\"name\":\"captioned-image\",\"properties\":{\"src\":\"https://pub-879bfd45a9774f1c80a8b77aca1f0aee.r2.dev/Namaste_(Trifoliata_Mystica)_by_Luke_Brown.webp\",\"width\":\"300\",\"artist\":\"Luke Brown\",\"title\":\"Namaste\\n\",\"align\":\"right\",\"top\":\"true\",\"border\":\"true\"}},{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"An \",{\"name\":\"b\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"autonomous entity\"]},\" is the experience of perceived contact with hallucinated beings that appear to be sentient and autonomous in their behaviour.\",{\"name\":\"ref\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"1\"}},{\"name\":\"ref\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"2\"}},{\"name\":\"ref\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"3\"}},{\"name\":\"ref\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"4\",\"no\":\"1\"}},{\"name\":\"ref\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"5\",\"no\":\"1\"}},{\"name\":\"ref\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"6\"}},{\"name\":\"ref\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"7\",\"no\":\"1\"}},{\"name\":\"ref\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"8\",\"no\":\"1\"}},{\"name\":\"ref\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"9\",\"no\":\"1\"}},\" These entities can manifest within both \",{\"name\":\"int-link\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"external-hallucination\"},\"children\":[\"external\"]},\" and \",{\"name\":\"int-link\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"internal-hallucination\"},\"children\":[\"internal hallucinations\"]},\".\",{\"name\":\"ref\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"8\",\"no\":\"2\"}}]},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Autonomous entities will frequently act as the inhabitants of a perceived independent reality.\",{\"name\":\"ref\",\"properties\":{\"to\":\"7\",\"no\":\"2\"}},\" They most commonly appear alone but can also often be within small or large groups alongside of other entities.

In regards to this particular notion, it is then often asserted that consciousness must be an antenna of sorts that receives either all or some of its subjective experiences from that of an unknown interdimensional source. Furthermore, the source of this received input is sometimes said to be adjustable depending on the person's brain state, with substances such as psychedelics simply tuning our consciousness into the analogous equivalent of a different radio station or TV channel. This is an idea that was once again further popularised by Terence Mckenna, who was famously quoted as saying: \\\"I don't believe consciousness is generated in the brain any more than television programs are made inside my TV.

Instead, I am quite sure that they are simply the psychedelic equivalent of the various characters and beings that most people commonly encounter within their dreams. Although it could be argued that autonomous entities are too characteristically different from that of dream characters to possibly be a result of the same neurological processes, I think that these differences in their appearance and behaviour are largely the result of the many other psychedelic effects that are simultaneously occurring during these encounters. The most notable one is geometry, which causes the hallucination to be comprised of the otherworldly shapes and patterns that provide autonomous entities with their distinctly \\\"hyperspatial\\\" aesthetic.

These questions have included math problems, metaphysical questions, philosophical questions, and queries pertaining to their general nature as beings inhabiting their particular world. However, each attempt at doing so has resulted in the entities simply ignoring the question, arrogantly scoffing at the absurdity of us asking them such a trivial thing, or replying with vague ambiguous wording that the person's own mind could have easily come up with.
