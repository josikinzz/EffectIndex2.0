It started as a young teenager when I began to realise that I no longer felt as if I was myself or that I even had a sense of self, alongside the sensation that my entire body and consciousness was in a state of mechanical autopilot. However, at the age of 17, my feelings of depersonalisation were spontaneously eradicated during a single LSD trip. This experience returned my sense of selfhood and gave me the profound sensation that I was not an electrochemical machine responding to external sensory input with fully pre-programmed responses. Instead, I realised that I was, in fact, a conscious agent living in an external world and completely capable of making my own choices through the application of free will, a state of mind which I have come to realise most people take entirely for granted. \"]},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\" Although this feeling of \\\"normalcy\\\" lasted the better part of 3 years, it eventually began to fade back into depersonalisation.

However, it's important to note that despite this persistent and continuous depersonalisation, my ability to function and live a happy life remains completely unaffected. This has left me with the impression that those who experience fear or disorientation when undergoing this state are not experiencing feelings that are intrinsic to the condition itself, but are instead responding to a forced change in their culturally embedded assumptions on the nature of human identity. \"]},\" \"]}]",{"_id":156,"length":157,"parsed":48,"raw":22},"606f5da4bc69a65a808e3138",0,[],[160],{"_id":161,"associated_effects":162,"associated_substances":163,"featured":164,"url":34,"title":33,"artist":165,"artist_url":166,"description":167,"date":22,"resource":168,"thumbnail":22,"type":169,"__v":157,"person":17},"5fba22cdbcd547522ac33ee7",[5],[],true,"Jon Ayal Cat","https://www.reddit.com/user/Jon_Ayal_Cat/","Seeing the world through a screen.","https://pub-879bfd45a9774f1c80a8b77aca1f0aee.r2.dev/depersonalization%20by%20john%20ayal%20cat.jpeg","image",[],1770927367475]
