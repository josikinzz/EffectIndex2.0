This results in the sensation that one is partially or completely detaching from both their sensory input and their conscious faculties.

This results in a complete perceptual disconnection from one's sense of sight, which can be described as the experience of being completely blinded and unable to tell whether the eyes are open or closed due to a total lack of sensory input. During this state, the effect often leads one into the experience of finding themselves floating through a dark and mostly empty hallucinatory void.[/p]\n\n[toc /]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[subarticle id=\"holes-spaces-voids\"][h2]Holes, spaces, and voids[/h2][/subarticle]\n[p][i]Holes, spaces and voids[/i] are a sub-component of visual disconnection that manifest when it has become all-encompassing in its intensity. This experience is more commonly known as a \"K-hole\"[ref to=\"1\" /][ref to=\"2\" /] and is generally discussed as something that is specifically associated with ketamine, despite being present within most traditional dissociatives. A K-hole can be described as the place a person finds themselves in once visual disconnection becomes powerful enough to leave the person incapable of receiving external sensory input, replacing their visual input with a space that subjectively feels as if it is outside of normal reality.[/p]\n[captioned-image src=\"/img/gallery/khole.jpg\" width=\"700\" border=\"true\" artist=\"Josie Kins\" title=\"The K-hole\" caption=\"This replication serves as a third person perspective replication of a K-hole experience.\" align=\"center\" /]\n[p]The visual appearance of this space, hole, or void can be described as a vast, mostly empty and darkened chamber that often feels and appears to be infinite in size. This space is usually dark black in its colour, but can occasionally display itself with large patches of slow-moving amorphous colour clouds or subtle geometric patterns across its horizon. At its higher levels, these voids are often populated with hallucinatory structures, which are comprehensively described and documented in the subsection below.[/p]\n\n[p]Alongside this visual experience, changes in gravity and a powerful sense of tactile disconnection are also usually present. This can result in one feeling as if they are undergoing an out-of-body experience while weightlessly floating through a void over great distances in a variety of different speeds, directions, and orientations. This is a feeling that is interpreted by many people as floating through space or the night sky.[/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[subarticle id=\"structures\"][h2]Structures[/h2][/subarticle]\n[p]Structures are the only feature found within what would otherwise be completely empty and uninhabited voids. These manifest as monolithic 3-dimensional shapes or structures of an infinite variety and size that float above, below, around, or in front of a person as they gradually zoom, rotate, transform, or pan into focus, gradually unveiling before the person's line of sight.[/p]\n\n[captioned-image gfycat=\"SeparateTepidHeifer\" title=\"Basic Structures\" artist=\"StasConstantine\" border=\"true\" caption=\"This animation serves as some examples of level 3 hallucinatory structures within a standard dissociative void\" align=\"center\" width=\"705\" height=\"430\" /]\n\n[p]These structures can take the form of any shape, but common examples include vast and giant pillars, columns, tunnels, blocks, buildings, slides, monuments, wheels, pyramids, caves, and a variety of abstract shapes. They are often fractal in shape and can manifest in a variety of colours, but usually follow darker themes and tones with an associated aesthetic that is sometimes subjectively interpreted as \"alien\" in nature.[/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"structure-types\"]Structure Types[/h3]\n[p]Structures can be broken down into the 4 basic levels of complexity and visual intensity described below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"2-dimensional structures\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, structures confine their form to strictly 2-Dimensional shapes. These shapes are usually flat and dark in their colour. Their presence is also often “felt” instead of seen. In terms of their size, these structures usually take up the entirety of a person's visual field but do not appear to have any particular sense of size attributed to them.[/headered-textbox]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined 3-dimensional structures\" labelBackground=\"#999997\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the structures become better defined and 3-dimensional in shape with some basic detail to their lighting and shadows. They appear to be comprised of semi-transparent condensed colour and are seen as ill-defined or out of focus around their edges. In terms of size, these structures appear to be extremely large, stretching out up to seemingly hundreds of meters.[/headered-textbox]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined 3-dimensional structures\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, structures become fully defined in their shape, edges, lighting, shadow, and detail. They often appear to be made of solid and dense realistic materials such as stone and metal. In terms of their size, they are capable of appearing as thousands of miles long and are often extremely complex in terms of their shape and texture.[/headered-textbox]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Structural machine-universes\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At its highest level, hallucinatory structures can be described as the sensation of seeing that which is subjectively perceived as the entire universe condensed into an infinitely vast and intricate ever-shifting machine structure. In terms of its appearance, this state is extremely hard to describe but has many subjective similarities to level 8A geometry. The structure can take any form, but usually appear as intricately shaped machine-like structures that are seemingly infinite in size and can convey huge amounts of innately understandable information. This experience is not just perceived through one's sense of sight but is also physically felt in an incomprehensible level of detail that manifests itself as complex cognitive and tactile sensations. The structure as a whole and the information it conveys are often innately interpreted as perceiving a structural representation of “the universe” or “everything”.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]Structures typically display themselves anywhere between 30 seconds to several minutes before the person experiencing them slips back into reality or into the presence of another structure. In terms of how these structures shift between each other, their transition processes can be broken down into 4 basic categories. These are described and documented below:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li][b]Structural transformations[/b] - Structures can switch between each other by transforming or shapeshifting in a static and comprehensible way. This is something that usually unfolds in a gradual step-by-step morphing process.[/li]\n[li][b]Structural panning[/b] - Structures can switch between each other by remaining completely static in their shape and simply panning out of view until they are no longer within one's field of vision. It’s from here that another structure usually comes into view from outside of one's peripheral vision within a few seconds to a couple of minutes.[/li]\n[li][b]Structural disintegration[/b] - Structures can switch between each other by disassembling into many tiny sections that resemble pixels, or building blocks. This occurs in a manner that is reminiscent of smoke or dust blowing in the wind. When forming through this style, the structure will appear to assemble itself step-by-step, becoming increasingly complex as it occurs.[/li]\n[li][b]Traveling over great distances[/b] - The third method of transitioning is experienced when the structures appear to be stationary whilst one is floating silently between them over what can feel like extreme physical distances. This floating is sometimes felt to occur on an invisible rail through the vast and infinite dissociative hole.\"[/li]\n[/ul]","[{\"name\":\"captioned-image\",\"properties\":{\"src\":\"https://pub-879bfd45a9774f1c80a8b77aca1f0aee.r2.dev/khole.jpg\",\"border\":\"true\",\"title\":\"White wolf drinking water\",\"artist\":\"Anonymous\",\"caption\":\"This animation serves as an example of visual drifting in the style of texture flowing.\",\"height\":\"420\",\"width\":\"299\",\"top\":\"true\"}},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[{\"name\":\"b\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Visual disconnection\"]},\" is the experience of becoming distanced and/or detached from one's sense of vision.
