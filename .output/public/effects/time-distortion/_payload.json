This is seemingly because these particular effects can result in a person perceiving a disproportionately large number of novel events occurring within a much smaller frame of time than they usually would. [/p] \n\n[p] Time dilation is most commonly induced under the influence of strong dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelics[/int-link][ref to=\"6\" /], [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociatives[/int-link][ref to=\"7\" /], and cannabinoids[ref to=\"8\" /].

During this reversal, the person's cognition and train of thought typically continues to play forward in a coherent and linear manner while they watch the external environment around them and their body's physical actions play in reverse. It is speculated that the experience of time reversal may potentially occur through a combination of [int-link to=\"/categories/hallucinatory-states\"]visual hallucinations[/int-link] and errors in memory encoding.

During this state, there is often a sense that the flow of time has ceased to function and has also become inherently meaningless. [/p]\n\n[p] While experiencing atemporality, one’s ability to conceptualize ordinary time may be compromised in several ways. For example, the concept of ‘one hour’ may no longer make any sense. As a different example, the concepts of ‘one second’ and ‘one year’ may both seem like a single well-defined unit.
