So I think it's worth noting that while they definitely get very close, there is actually not a single replication or example of visionary artwork shown in this video that quite fully captures the true complexity of psychedelic geometry. I used to think that doing so was simply an impossible goal, but at this point I'm certain that it could be done with todays technology using high budget 3D modelling.\n\nWhile there are definitely examples of traditional visionary artwork such as these ones which do genuinely capture the essence of at least one single frame of psychedelic geometry, when it comes to animating the continuously moving and shapeshifting manner in which geometry manifests, i think it's going to take a very deliberate and concerted effort from within the replication community to truly get there.\n\nOn an entirely different note, this effect was probably the one particular aspect of the psychedelic experience that most quickly convinced me that these substances are incredibly profound and essential tools for humanity. Almost a decade ago as a young 17-year-old undergoing my first couple of hallucinogenic experiences, I found myself immediately fascinated by the sheer incomprehensibility of the beautiful patterns which my mind was producing. \n\nSince then and based on countless personal experiences, I have come to the conclusion that this effect is not simply another form of hallucination, but instead a result of neurological signals and processes from various regions of the brain bleeding into the visual cortex and being reinterpreted as complex geometric forms in a manner which is comparable to that of synaesthesia. I obviously cannot tout this assertion as fact or anything, but to me this would explain multiple aspects of geometries behaviour, such as the way in which geometry commonly feels as if it is an innately understandable visual representation of one's emotional state, sensory input, and even complex concepts or thoughts.

For example, many people will claim that LSD geometry looks synthetic and digital in style; however, psilocybin geometryon the other hand, is often said to look comparatively organic and natural. \\n\\nAlong side of this, in terms of geometry's less subjective potential stylistic differences, the patterns experienced during this state can be broken down into a wide range of approximate stylistic variations, which include but are certainly not limited to the following examples.\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"separated-textbox\",\"properties\":{\"a\":\"Intricate\",\"b\":\"Simple\"},\"children\":[\" \"]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"separated-textbox\",\"properties\":{\"a\":\"Algorithmic\",\"b\":\"Abstract\"},\"children\":[\" \"]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"separated-textbox\",\"properties\":{\"a\":\"Unstructured\",\"b\":\"Structured\"},\"children\":[\" \"]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"separated-textbox\",\"properties\":{\"a\":\"Dimly lit\",\"b\":\"Brightly lit\"},\"children\":[\" \"]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"separated-textbox\",\"properties\":{\"a\":\"Multicoloured\",\"b\":\"Monotone \"},\"children\":[\" \"]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"separated-textbox\",\"properties\":{\"a\":\"Flat shading\",\"b\":\"Glossy shading\"},\"children\":[\" \"]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"separated-textbox\",\"properties\":{\"a\":\"Sharp edges\",\"b\":\"Soft edges\"},\"children\":[\" \"]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"separated-textbox\",\"properties\":{\"a\":\"Large\",\"b\":\"Small\"},\"children\":[\" \"]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"separated-textbox\",\"properties\":{\"a\":\"Fast\",\"b\":\"Slow\"},\"children\":[\" \"]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"separated-textbox\",\"properties\":{\"a\":\"Smooth\",\"b\":\"Jittery\"},\"children\":[\" \"]},\"\\n\",{\"name\":\"separated-textbox\",\"properties\":{\"a\":\"Round corners\",\"b\":\"Angular corners\"},\"children\":[\" \"]}]",1450,{"raw":23,"parsed":36,"length":37},"[{\"name\":\"quote\",\"properties\":{\"author\":\"Josie Kins\",\"profile\":\"Josie\"},\"children\":[\"Now to wrap this video up I'd just like to make a few points. So I think it's worth noting that while they definitely get very close, there is actually not a single replication or example of visionary artwork shown in this video that quite fully captures the true complexity of psychedelic geometry. I used to think that doing so was simply an impossible goal, but at this point I'm certain that it could be done with todays technology using high budget 3D modelling.\\n\\nWhile there are definitely examples of traditional visionary artwork such as these ones which do genuinely capture the essence of at least one single frame of psychedelic geometry, when it comes to animating the continuously moving and shapeshifting manner in which geometry manifests, i think it's going to take a very deliberate and concerted effort from within the replication community to truly get there.\\n\\nOn an entirely different note, this effect was probably the one particular aspect of the psychedelic experience that most quickly convinced me that these substances are incredibly profound and essential tools for humanity. Almost a decade ago as a young 17-year-old undergoing my first couple of hallucinogenic experiences, I found myself immediately fascinated by the sheer incomprehensibility of the beautiful patterns which my mind was producing. \\n\\nSince then and based on countless personal experiences, I have come to the conclusion that this effect is not simply another form of hallucination, but instead a result of neurological signals and processes from various regions of the brain bleeding into the visual cortex and being reinterpreted as complex geometric forms in a manner which is comparable to that of synaesthesia. I obviously cannot tout this assertion as fact or anything, but to me this would explain multiple aspects of geometries behaviour, such as the way in which geometry commonly feels as if it is an innately understandable visual representation of one's emotional state, sensory input, and even complex concepts or thoughts. If this is true, it also implies that psychedelic geometry is the profound experience of being able to indirectly see the hidden architecture and complex programming of human consciousness.\"]},\"\\n\\nIf you've made it this far into the video, thanks so much for watching!
