This state of mind can often result in [int-link to=\"/effects/thought-loops\"]thought loops[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/confusion\"]confusion[/int-link], disorientation, and a loss of control, especially for the inexperienced.

This results in one experiencing an increased difficulty recalling basic concepts and autobiographical information from their long-term memory. Compounded with the complete suppression of short-term memory, it creates an altered state where even basic tasks become challenging or impossible as one cannot mentally access past memories of how to complete them. For example, one may take a longer time to recall the identity of close friends or temporarily forget how to perform basic tasks. This state may create the sensation of experiencing something for the first time. At this stage, a reduction of certain learned personality traits, awareness of cultural norms, and linguistic recall may accompany the suppression of long-term memory.\n[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Complete long-term memory suppression\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]At the highest level, this effect is the complete and persistent failure of both a person's long and short-term memory. This results in one becoming completely incapable of remembering even the most basic fundamental concepts stored within their long-term memory. This includes everything from their name, hometown, past memories, the awareness of being on drugs, what drugs even are, what human beings are, what life is, that time exists, what anything is, or that anything exists. Memory suppression of this level blocks all mental associations, attached meaning, acquired preferences, and value judgements one may have towards the external world. Sufficiently intense memory loss is also associated with the loss of a sense of self referred to as [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link], in which one is no longer aware of their own existence. In this state, the user is unable to recall all learned conceptual knowledge about themselves and the external world, and no longer experiences the sensation of being a separate observer in an external world.\n[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p] It is worth noting that although memory suppression is vaguely similar in its effects to [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link], it differs in that it directly suppresses one's usage of their long or short term memory without inhibiting the person's ability to recall what happened during the experience afterwards. In contrast, amnesia does not directly affect the usage of one's short or long-term memory during its experience; instead, it renders a person incapable of recalling events after it has worn off. A person experiencing memory suppression cannot access their existing memory, while a person with drug-induced amnesia cannot properly store new memories. As such, a person experiencing amnesia may not obviously appear to be doing so, as they can often carry on normal conversations and perform complex tasks.

Compounded with the complete suppression of short-term memory, it creates an altered state where even basic tasks become challenging or impossible as one cannot mentally access past memories of how to complete them. For example, one may take a longer time to recall the identity of close friends or temporarily forget how to perform basic tasks. This state may create the sensation of experiencing something for the first time.

A person experiencing memory suppression cannot access their existing memory, while a person with drug-induced amnesia cannot properly store new memories.
