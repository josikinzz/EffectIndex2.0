For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively their “ego” or a combination of their “ego” and physical body, this effect can cause their sense of identity to also include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. This results in intense and inextricable feelings of unity or interconnectedness between oneself and varying arrays of previously \"external\" systems.[/p]\n\n[p]It is worth noting that many people who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, the destruction of which is often described as some sort of profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.” However, it is important to understand that these conclusions and feelings should not necessarily be accepted at face value as inherently true.[/p]\n\n[p]Feelings of unity and interconnectedness most commonly occur under the influence of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] compounds, such as LSD, DMT, ayahuasca, mescaline, and ketamine. However, they can also occur during well-practiced meditation, deep states of contemplation, and intense focus.[/p]\n\n[p]There are a total of four distinct levels of identity a person can experience during this state. These various altered states of unity have been arranged into a leveling system that orders its different states from least to the most number of concepts that one's identity is currently attributed to. These levels are described below. [/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Unity between specific external systems\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]At the lowest level, this effect can be described as a perceived sense of unity between two or more systems within the external environment, which are usually perceived as separate from each other in everyday life. This is the least complex level of unity, as it is the only level of interconnectedness where the subjective experience of unity does not involve a state of interconnectedness between the self and the external.[/p]\n\n[p]There are an endless number of ways in which this level can manifest, but common examples of the experience often include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] A sense of unity between specific living things, such as animals or plants and their surrounding ecosystems. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between other human beings and the objects they are currently interacting with. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between any number of currently perceivable inanimate objects. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between humanity and nature. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between literally any combination of perceivable external systems and concepts. [/li]\n[/ul]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Unity between the self and specific external systems\" labelBackground=\"#999997\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]At this level, unity can be described as feeling as if one's identity (in addition to the body and/or brain) is attributed to specific external systems or concepts within the immediate environment, particularly those that would usually be considered as intrinsically separate from one's own being.[/p]\n\n[p]The experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the specific physical systems or concepts that are currently the subject of a person's attention within the perceivable external environment. This creates a sensation of becoming inextricably \"connected to\", \"one with\", \"the same as\", or \"unified\" with whatever the perceived external system happens to be.[/p]\n\n[p]There are an endless number of ways in which this level can manifest itself, but common examples of the experience often include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li] Becoming unified with and identifying with a specific object that one is interacting with. [/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with another person or multiple people. This is particularly common if they are engaging in sexual or romantic activities.[/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with the entirety of one's own physical body.[/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with large crowds of people. This is particularly common at raves and music festivals.[/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with the external environment, but not the people within it.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[/headered-textbox]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Unity between the self and all perceivable external systems\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]At this level, unity can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to the entirety of their immediately perceivable external environment due to a loss of perceived boundaries between the previously separate systems.[/p]\n\n[p]The effect creates a sensation that a person has become \"one with their surroundings.” This is felt to be the result of a person’s sense of self becoming attributed to the internal narrative of the ego as well as the body itself and everything physically percepted around it. It creates the compelling perspective that one is the external environment experiencing itself through a specific point within it, namely the physical sensory perceptions of the body that one's consciousness is currently residing in.[/p]\n\n[p]It is at this point that a key component of the high-level unity experience becomes an extremely noticeable factor. Once a person's sense of self has become attributed to the entirety of their surroundings, this new perspective completely changes how it feels to physically interact with what was previously felt to be an external system in one's environment. For example, when one is not in this state and is interacting with a physical object, it typically feels as though one is a central agent acting on the separate world around them. However, while undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object consistently feels as if the whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself with no central, separate agent operating the process of interaction. Instead, the process suddenly feels as if it has become completely decentralized and holistic, as the environment begins to autonomously and harmoniously respond to itself in a predetermined manner to perform the interaction carried out by the individual.[/p] [/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Unity between the self and all known external systems\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n\n[p]At the highest level, this effect can be described as feeling as if one's identity is simultaneously attributed to the entirety of the immediately perceivable external environment and all known concepts that exist outside of it. These known concepts typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe as it presently stands in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted by people as \"becoming one with the universe\".[/p]\n\n[p]When experienced, the effect creates the sudden perspective that one is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through a specific point in space and time that this particular body and conscious perception currently resides within. People who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.”[/p]\n\n[p]Although they are not necessarily literal truths about reality, many commonly reported conclusions share common themes of a religious and metaphysical nature, which are often interpreted as profound realizations. These are described and listed below:[/p]\n\n\n[ul]\n[li] The sudden and total acceptance of death as a fundamental complement of life. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of oneself, but simply the end of this specific point of a greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist and live on through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as inevitable and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment. [/li]\n[li] The subjective perspective that one's preconceived notions of \"god\" or deities are felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all possible power (omnipotence), all possible knowledge (omniscience), is self-creating and self-sustaining, then the universe and its contents could also be viewed as \"god\". [/li]\n[li] The subjective perspective that one, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all humanity's sufferings and flaws, but also includes its acts of love and achievements.

The two sections are connected into each other via arrows to demonstrate that it is a singular and unified system.\" border=\"true\" align=\"right\" /]\n\n[p][b]Unity and interconnectedness[/b] refers to the feeling that things which are normally considered to be separate are actually interconnected or are the same thing entirely, and especially that a person’s sense of self has been expanded to include one or more concepts that would typically be considered separate from them. For example, a person may feel like there is no true separation between themself and the environment around them.[/p]\n\n[p]This experience can be interpreted as the removal of an illusion that there ever was a genuine separation between the self and the surrounding environment in the first place. The destruction of this illusion is then often described as some sort of profound “[i]awakening[/i]” or “[i]enlightenment[/i].” [/p]\n\n[p]Feelings of unity and interconnectedness most commonly occur under the influence of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] compounds, such as LSD, DMT, ayahuasca, mescaline, and ketamine. However, they can also occur during well-practiced meditation, deep states of contemplation, and intense focus.[/p]\n\n[toc /]\n\n[h2 id=\"levels\"]Levels[/h2]\n\n[p]There are four distinct levels of unity and interconnectedness a person can experience. These levels are presented below and are organized from least to most complex.[/p]\n\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"level-1\" label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Unity between specific external systems\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]Level one is the perception of a unity between two or more things which are usually perceived as separate from each other within the external environment.[/p]\n\n[p]All levels of unity and interconnectedness can manifest in endless ways, but common examples of level one include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] A sense of unity between specific living things, such as animals or plants and their surrounding ecosystems. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between other human beings and the objects they are currently interacting with. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between any number of currently perceivable inanimate objects. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between humanity and nature. [/li]\n  [li] And finally, a sense of unity between literally any combination of perceivable external systems and concepts. [/li]\n[/ul]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"level-2\" label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Unity between the self and specific external systems\" labelBackground=\"#999997\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]Level two is the feeling that one's identity has come to include something within the immediate external environment, particularly something that is currently the subject of a person's attention. This creates a sensation of becoming inextricably \"[i]connected to[/i]\", \"[i]one with[/i]\", \"[i]the same as[/i]\", or \"[i]unified[/i]\" with that thing.\n[/p]\n\n[p]Common examples of level two include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li] Becoming unified with and identifying with a specific object that one is interacting with. [/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with another person or multiple people. This is particularly common if they are engaging in sexual or romantic activities.[/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with the entirety of one's own physical body.[/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with large crowds of people. This is particularly common at raves and music festivals.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"level-3\" label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Unity between the self and all perceivable external systems\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]Level three is the feeling that one's identity includes the entirety of their immediately perceivable external environment. This effect creates a sensation that the boundaries between a person and the world around them have been stripped down, resulting in the compelling perspective that someone is their environment, that the environment therefore has a consciousness, and this conscious environment is now experiencing itself through the point of view of the person’s individual sensory awareness.[/p]\n\n[p]This level introduces a key component of high-level unity - once a person's sense of self has become unified with their surroundings, their experience of interacting with those surroundings is fundamentally transformed. While undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object can feel like a whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself. For example, if a person experiencing level three unity is thirsty, it doesn’t feel like a person is going to get water. Instead, it feels like the overall system has identified a requirement within one of its subsystems, and is therefore harmoniously rearranging itself to fulfill the requirement.[/p] [/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"level-4\" label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Unity between the self and all known external systems\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n\n[p]At the highest level, Unity can feel as if one is simultaneously the entirety of the perceivable environment and all known concepts that exist outside of it. This will typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted as \"[i]becoming one with the universe[/i]\".[/p]\n\n[p]When experienced, this effect creates the sudden perspective that one is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through a specific point in space and time, specifically, the person experiencing the effect. People who undergo this experience commonly interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of profound “[i]awakening[/i]” or “[i]enlightenment[/i].”[/p]\n\n[p]Many reported experiences of level 4 unity and interconnectedness share common themes of a religious and metaphysical nature. Some examples include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li] The sudden and total acceptance of death as an aspect of life and existence. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of oneself, but simply the end of this specific point in the greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as inevitable and not a cause for grief or any emotional attachment. [/li]\n[li] The subjective perspective that one's conception of \"god\" or “godhood” is identical or similar to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all power (omnipotence) and all knowledge (omniscience), and is the creator and sustainer of existence, then the universe and its contents could also be understood as \"god\". This realisation is extremely similar to the core tenants of the religion of Pantheism.[/li]\n[li] The subjective perspective that one, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all of humanity's sufferings and flaws, but also includes its acts of love and achievements.

So instead, this article will summarise a few of the more interesting and easily citable examples.[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li]The 11-D altered states of consciousness scale lists one of its 3 major factors as \"oceanic boundlessness,\" and it includes an entire subfactor titled \"Experience of Unity\".[/li]\n\n[li]Benny Shanon's book the Antipode's of the Mind lists Unity as a subtype of Spiritual and Mystical Experience within the chapter on Ayahuasca-Induced Non-Ordinary Effects of Consciousness.[/li]\n\n[li]The [ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulgin_Rating_Scale\"]Shulgin Rating Scale[/ext-link] describes an experience of high level unity and insists that learning how to reliably induce it would be \"the ultimate evolution and the end of the human experiment.[/li]\n\n[li]Stanislov Grof includes a detailed description of \"Oneness with Life and All Creation\" alongside other similar experiences within his extremely frustrating book titled \"Realms of the Human Unconscious\".[/li] \n\n[li]The Mystical Experience Questionnaire, a widely used and validated psychometric tool for measuring mystical experiences, divides the experience into Internal Unity and External Unity.

This effect was further solidified in my mind as something of extreme significance after I found the works of Alan Watts through his philosophical lectures and writings. I then proceeded to dive headfirst into meditation and obsessively contemplating the supposedly illusory nature of the self on a daily basis.

This caused me to inevitably let my guard down for what was to come. Approximately two years later while under the influence of ayahuasca, I spontaneously found myself undergoing a state of level 4 unity for the first time in my life.

As far as I can tell, it seems that certain individuals are much more prone to it than others, but almost everybody will inevitably experience this if they trip regularly enough over a long period of time. It does not seem to be dependent on the dosage or the psychedelic in question, although set and setting seems to be at least somewhat of a factor. Situations involving beautiful nature, deep contemplation, and philosophical conversation can often cause it to come about, but not in a reliable or reproducible fashion.
