[/p]\n\n[p] Major depression affects 5-20% of the population at some point in their life.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"2\" /] It results from the combination of genetics and environments with a heritability of greater than 30%. Common environmental influences (parenting style, socioeconomic status, or local environmental qualities) are quite small; however this does not mean these influences are irrelevant. What seems to matter is how a specific individual interacts with their environment across developmental stages.[ref to=\"5\" no=\"1\" /] Stressful life events are significantly associated with depression.[ref to=\"6\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Depression is a life-threatening disorder. Both depression and subclinical depression increase all-cause mortality similarly; [ref to=\"7\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"8\" no=\"1\" /]however subclinical depression does not have an exact definition yet (making it harder to study). The impact depression has on quality of life is comparable or greater than other chronic medical illnesses.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"3\" /] [/p]\n\n[h3] Cognitive Impairment [/h3]\n\n[p] Cognitive impairment is a core feature of depression that remains after remission and cannot be considered a result of low mood.[ref to=\"9\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"10\" no=\"1\" /]Although there is some evidence associating depressivity and functionality, depression severity accounts for -at most- 10% of the variability in cognitive dysfunction. Both age of onset and depression severity also modify this effect’s magnitude and what cognitive deficits arise.[ref to=\"11\" no=\"1\" /]As a generality (not developed in parallel), more severe depression correlates with significant decreases in cognitive performance. [ref to=\"9\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"11\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] Moderate decrease: Executive function, Attention, Episodic memory (not semantic or visuo-spatial) [/li]\n  [li] Mild decrease: Processing speed [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]These cognitive deficits are significantly associated with poor psychosocial functioning (psychological factors combined with the surrounding social environment). [/p]\n\n[h3] Psychosocial impairment [/h3]\n\n[p] Psychosocial impairment is also a core feature of depression that remains after remission. Psychosocial stressors are associated with the onset, severity, and progression of MDD.[ref to=\"12\" no=\"1\" /]More severe depression can be considered a disability, or disorder, of psychosocial function.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"4\" /]Even brief psychosocial interventions in the form of collaborative care (e.g. a telephone call reminding to take medication) may be comparably effective to more intensive forms of face-to-face psychotherapy.[ref to=\"13\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Improving cognitive deficits may also improve psychosocial functioning. Although impaired attention and executive functions remain in patients whose depressive symptoms alleviate, memory functions may improve to only a small deficit. [ref to=\"9\" no=\"3\" /] Improvements in mood are most closely related to improvements in verbal memory, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed. [/p]\n\n[h3] Immune System [/h3] \n\n[p] Depression is accompanied by immune system dysregulation and activation of the body’s inflammatory response system.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"5\" /] [ref to=\"7\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"14\" no=\"1\" /] Specific biomarkers have small but significantly higher concentrations associated with the incidence and severity of depression. [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) [ref to=\"3\" no=\"6\" /] [/li]\n  [li] Chemokines for Monocyte Chemotactic Protein (MCP)-1/CCL2 [ref to=\"14\" no=\"2\" /] [/li]\n  [li] C Reactive protein[ref to=\"7\" no=\"3\" /] and its interleukin precursors: [/li]\n  [li] Interleukin-6 (IL-6), associated with reduced hippocampal grey matter volume and is increased with higher BMI via Leptin[ref to=\"3\" no=\"7\" /] [ref to=\"7\" no=\"4\" /] [/li]\n  [li] IL-1ra,[ref to=\"7\" no=\"5\" /] but not IL1-β[ref to=\"3\" no=\"8\" /] | IL1 is difficult to detect in plasma since it works primarily at the local site of inflammation and new forms are still being discovered. [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p] It is difficult to say how biological sex interacts due to increasing the number of females in a sample causing the relationship between depression and inflammation to become nonsignificant.[ref to=\"7\" no=\"6\" /]Estrogen interacts with CRP and IL6, thus fluctuations in menstrual cycles and hormonal contraceptives may affect these results. Yet, overall the fundamental genetic architecture appears the same across samples and genders.[ref to=\"5\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] These proinflammatory small protein messengers, called cytokines, increase indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression in both central and peripheral immune-competent cells. IDO increases the synthesis of kynurenine from dietary tryptophan, so this may cause a decrease in tryptophan availability. Tryptophan is required to synthesize serotonin and melatonin.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"9\" /]Additionally, there is no evidence the serotonin transporter genotype alone or in interaction with stressful life events is associated with an elevated risk of depression.[ref to=\"6\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Kynurenine also produces endogenous NMDA agonist metabolites that could disrupt neurotransmission along glutaminergic pathways and lead to excitotoxicity in the form of hippocampal neuron damage/death.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"10\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Within the central nervous system, proinflammatory cytokines play important roles in the body’s stress response system and within the regulation of neurogenesis.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"11\" /]\n[markdown text=\"#### HPA AXIS\" /]Stress response is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"12\" /]The HPA axis allows organisms to adapt to physical and psychosocial changes in their environments. There is a substantial link between MDD and HPA abnormalities and it is well established that approximately half of depressed patients have HPA axis hyperactivity.[ref to=\"10\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"12\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone commonly pointed to as mediating stress response, is just one component of the complex HPA system; note that total plasma cortisol does not represent the bioactive or 'free' portion of cortisol that is available to bind to target receptors and produce physiological effects. Regardless, it is typical for higher cortisol to inhibit this adaptation mechanism in the hippocampus. [/p]\n\n[p] Adaptation can be separated into three phases, each with different physiological processes. Mineralocorticoid receptors regulate cortisol during periods of low HPA activity. Glucocorticoid receptors regulate response to stress and cortisol during high HPA activity. [/p]\n\n[ol]\n  [li] Baseline: unstimulated, non-stressed. [/li]\n  [li] Stress reactivity: cortisol increases from baseline. [/li]\n  [li] Stress recovery: following offset of the stressor, cortisol levels return to baseline. [/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[p] Major Depression Disorder patients have impaired stress reactivity and recovery, with more severe depression being more impairing. They have greatly higher overall baseline cortisol that subsequently changes less in response to new stressors. This is exhibited behaviorally through higher overall negative emotions and less emotional reactivity to new negative stimuli. [/p]\n\n[p] Time of day also has a significant effect on the relationship between depression and cortisol. Typically, in nondepressed patients, cortisol is highest in the morning and lower in the afternoon. MDD patients have much lower baseline baseline cortisol levels in the morning and higher baselines in the afternoon.[ref to=\"12\" no=\"3\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Stress robustly reduces neurogenesis and the genes responsible for it in the brain. Antidepressants almost universally promote neurogenesis and neurotrophic factor gene expression.[ref to=\"15\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[h3] Hippocampus Reduction [/h3]\n\n[p] Although not only specific to depression, depressed patients display smaller hippocampus volume.[ref to=\"10\" no=\"3\" /][ref to=\"15\" no=\"2\" /]The arrow of causality is not entirely clear: does depression cause shrinkage or are people with a smaller hippocampus more susceptible to depression? [/p] \n\n[p] Although the mechanism of action is still undetermined, serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels are abnormally low in MDD and elevate during antidepressant treatment. This potentially makes it a good biomarker to indicate the presence of depression and responsiveness to antidepressants.[ref to=\"15\" no=\"3\" /][ref to=\"16\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Postmortem studies on patients with MDD or Bipolar Disorder suggest depression is a disorder of neuroplasticity and cellular resilience.

Both depression and subclinical depression increase all-cause mortality similarly; [ref to=\"7\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"8\" no=\"1\" /]however subclinical depression does not have an exact definition yet (making it harder to study). The impact depression has on quality of life is comparable or greater than other chronic medical illnesses.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"3\" /] [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"cognitive-impairment\"] Cognitive Impairment [/h3]\n\n[p] Cognitive impairment is a core feature of depression that remains after remission and cannot be considered a result of low mood.[ref to=\"9\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"10\" no=\"1\" /]Although there is some evidence associating depressivity and functionality, depression severity accounts for -at most- 10% of the variability in cognitive dysfunction. Both age of onset and depression severity also modify this effect’s magnitude and what cognitive deficits arise.[ref to=\"11\" no=\"1\" /]As a generality (not developed in parallel), more severe depression correlates with significant decreases in cognitive performance. [ref to=\"9\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"11\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] Moderate decrease: Executive function, Attention, Episodic memory (not semantic or visuo-spatial) [/li]\n  [li] Mild decrease: Processing speed [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]These cognitive deficits are significantly associated with poor psychosocial functioning (psychological factors combined with the surrounding social environment). [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"psychosocial-impairment\"] Psychosocial impairment [/h3]\n\n[p] Psychosocial impairment is also a core feature of depression that remains after remission. Psychosocial stressors are associated with the onset, severity, and progression of MDD.[ref to=\"12\" no=\"1\" /]More severe depression can be considered a disability, or disorder, of psychosocial function.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"4\" /]Even brief psychosocial interventions in the form of collaborative care (e.g. a telephone call reminding to take medication) may be comparably effective to more intensive forms of face-to-face psychotherapy.[ref to=\"13\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Improving cognitive deficits may also improve psychosocial functioning. Although impaired attention and executive functions remain in patients whose depressive symptoms alleviate, memory functions may improve to only a small deficit. [ref to=\"9\" no=\"3\" /] Improvements in mood are most closely related to improvements in verbal memory, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed. [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"immune-system\"] Immune System [/h3] \n\n[p] Depression is accompanied by immune system dysregulation and activation of the body’s inflammatory response system.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"5\" /] [ref to=\"7\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"14\" no=\"1\" /] Specific biomarkers have small but significantly higher concentrations associated with the incidence and severity of depression. [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) [ref to=\"3\" no=\"6\" /] [/li]\n  [li] Chemokines for Monocyte Chemotactic Protein (MCP)-1/CCL2 [ref to=\"14\" no=\"2\" /] [/li]\n  [li] C Reactive protein[ref to=\"7\" no=\"3\" /] and its interleukin precursors: [/li]\n  [li] Interleukin-6 (IL-6), associated with reduced hippocampal grey matter volume and is increased with higher BMI via Leptin[ref to=\"3\" no=\"7\" /] [ref to=\"7\" no=\"4\" /] [/li]\n  [li] IL-1ra,[ref to=\"7\" no=\"5\" /] but not IL1-β[ref to=\"3\" no=\"8\" /] | IL1 is difficult to detect in plasma since it works primarily at the local site of inflammation and new forms are still being discovered. [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p] It is difficult to say how biological sex interacts due to increasing the number of females in a sample causing the relationship between depression and inflammation to become nonsignificant.[ref to=\"7\" no=\"6\" /]Estrogen interacts with CRP and IL6, thus fluctuations in menstrual cycles and hormonal contraceptives may affect these results. Yet, overall the fundamental genetic architecture appears the same across samples and genders.[ref to=\"5\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] These proinflammatory small protein messengers, called cytokines, increase indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression in both central and peripheral immune-competent cells. IDO increases the synthesis of kynurenine from dietary tryptophan, so this may cause a decrease in tryptophan availability. Tryptophan is required to synthesize serotonin and melatonin.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"9\" /]Additionally, there is no evidence the serotonin transporter genotype alone or in interaction with stressful life events is associated with an elevated risk of depression.[ref to=\"6\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Kynurenine also produces endogenous NMDA agonist metabolites that could disrupt neurotransmission along glutaminergic pathways and lead to excitotoxicity in the form of hippocampal neuron damage/death.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"10\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Within the central nervous system, proinflammatory cytokines play important roles in the body’s stress response system and within the regulation of neurogenesis.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"11\" /]\n[markdown text=\"#### HPA AXIS\" /]Stress response is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"12\" /]The HPA axis allows organisms to adapt to physical and psychosocial changes in their environments. There is a substantial link between MDD and HPA abnormalities and it is well established that approximately half of depressed patients have HPA axis hyperactivity.[ref to=\"10\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"12\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone commonly pointed to as mediating stress response, is just one component of the complex HPA system; note that total plasma cortisol does not represent the bioactive or 'free' portion of cortisol that is available to bind to target receptors and produce physiological effects. Regardless, it is typical for higher cortisol to inhibit this adaptation mechanism in the hippocampus. [/p]\n\n[p] Adaptation can be separated into three phases, each with different physiological processes. Mineralocorticoid receptors regulate cortisol during periods of low HPA activity. Glucocorticoid receptors regulate response to stress and cortisol during high HPA activity. [/p]\n\n[ol]\n  [li] Baseline: unstimulated, non-stressed. [/li]\n  [li] Stress reactivity: cortisol increases from baseline. [/li]\n  [li] Stress recovery: following offset of the stressor, cortisol levels return to baseline. [/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[p] Major Depression Disorder patients have impaired stress reactivity and recovery, with more severe depression being more impairing. They have greatly higher overall baseline cortisol that subsequently changes less in response to new stressors. This is exhibited behaviorally through higher overall negative emotions and less emotional reactivity to new negative stimuli. [/p]\n\n[p] Time of day also has a significant effect on the relationship between depression and cortisol. Typically, in nondepressed patients, cortisol is highest in the morning and lower in the afternoon. MDD patients have much lower baseline baseline cortisol levels in the morning and higher baselines in the afternoon.[ref to=\"12\" no=\"3\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Stress robustly reduces neurogenesis and the genes responsible for it in the brain. Antidepressants almost universally promote neurogenesis and neurotrophic factor gene expression.[ref to=\"15\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"hippocampus-reduction\"] Hippocampus Reduction [/h3]\n\n[p] Although not only specific to depression, depressed patients display smaller hippocampus volume.[ref to=\"10\" no=\"3\" /][ref to=\"15\" no=\"2\" /]The arrow of causality is not entirely clear: does depression cause shrinkage or are people with a smaller hippocampus more susceptible to depression? [/p] \n\n[p] Although the mechanism of action is still undetermined, serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels are abnormally low in MDD and elevate during antidepressant treatment. This potentially makes it a good biomarker to indicate the presence of depression and responsiveness to antidepressants.[ref to=\"15\" no=\"3\" /][ref to=\"16\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Postmortem studies on patients with MDD or Bipolar Disorder suggest depression is a disorder of neuroplasticity and cellular resilience. It is not a neurodegenerative disease.
